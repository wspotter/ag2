CrewAI provides a variety of powerful tools designed for tasks such as web scraping, search, code interpretation, and more. These tools are easy to integrate into the AG2 framework, allowing you to enhance your agents with advanced capabilities. You can explore the full list of available tools in the [CrewAI Tools](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-tools/tree/main) repository.

### Installation

<Warning>
At the moment CrewAI tool work for python < 3.13, so to use them, please make sure you are using an appropriate version of python.
</Warning>

Install the required packages for integrating CrewAI tools into the AG2 framework.
This ensures all dependencies for both frameworks are installed.

```bash
pip install ag2[openai,interop-crewai]
```

### Imports

Import necessary modules and tools.
- [ScrapeWebsiteTool](https://docs.crewai.com/tools/scrapewebsitetool): A CrewAI tool for web scraping.
- [`AssistantAgent`](/docs/api-reference/autogen/AssistantAgent) and [`UserProxyAgent`](/docs/api-reference/autogen/UserProxyAgent): Core AG2 classes.
- [`Interoperability`](/docs/api-reference/autogen/interop/overview): This module acts as a bridge, making it easier to integrate CrewAI tools with AG2’s architecture.

```python
import os

from crewai_tools import ScrapeWebsiteTool

from autogen import AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent, LLMConfig
from autogen.interop import Interoperability
```

### Agent Configuration

Configure the agents for the interaction.
- `config_list` defines the LLM configurations, including the model and API key.
- [`UserProxyAgent`](/docs/api-reference/autogen/UserProxyAgent) simulates user inputs without requiring actual human interaction (set to `NEVER`).
- [`AssistantAgent`](/docs/api-reference/autogen/AssistantAgent) represents the AI agent, configured with the LLM settings.

```python
config_list = [{"api_type": "openai", "model": "gpt-4o", "api_key": os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]}]
user_proxy = UserProxyAgent(
    name="User",
    human_input_mode="NEVER",
)

chatbot = AssistantAgent(
    name="chatbot",
    llm_config=LLMConfig(config_list=config_list),
)
```

### Tool Integration

Integrate the CrewAI tool with AG2.
- [`Interoperability`](/docs/reference/interop/interoperability) converts the CrewAI tool to a format compatible with AG2.
- [ScrapeWebsiteTool](https://docs.crewai.com/tools/scrapewebsitetool) is used for web scraping tasks.
- Register the tool for both execution and interaction with LLMs.

```python
interop = Interoperability()
crewai_tool = ScrapeWebsiteTool()
ag2_tool = interop.convert_tool(tool=crewai_tool, type="crewai")

ag2_tool.register_for_execution(user_proxy)
ag2_tool.register_for_llm(chatbot)
```

### Initiating the chat
Initiate the conversation between the [`UserProxyAgent`](/docs/api-reference/autogen/UserProxyAgent) and the [`AssistantAgent`](/docs/api-reference/autogen/AssistantAgent) to utilize the CrewAI tool.
```python
message = "Scrape the website https://ag2.ai/"
chat_result = user_proxy.initiate_chat(recipient=chatbot, message=message, max_turns=2)
```

### Output
The `chatbot` provides results based on the web scraping operation:

```console
User (to chatbot):

Scrape the website https://ag2.ai/
