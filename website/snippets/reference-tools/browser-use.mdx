### Installation

<Warning>
[`Browser Use`](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use) requires **Python 3.11 or higher**.
</Warning>

To get started with the `Browser Use` integration in AG2, follow these steps:

1. Install AG2 with the `browser-use` extra:
    ```bash
    pip install ag2[openai,browser-use]
    ```
    <Tip>
    If you have been using `autogen` or `pyautogen`, all you need to do is upgrade it using:
    ```bash
    pip install -U autogen[openai,browser-use]
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    pip install -U pyautogen[openai,browser-use]
    ```
    as `pyautogen`, `autogen`, and `ag2` are aliases for the same PyPI package.
    </Tip>
2. Set up Playwright:

    ```bash
    # Installs Playwright and browsers for all OS
    playwright install
    # Additional command, mandatory for Linux only
    playwright install-deps
    ```

3. For running the code in Jupyter, use `nest_asyncio` to allow nested event loops.
    ```bash
    pip install nest_asyncio
    ```

You're all set! Now you can start using browsing features in AG2.

### Imports

```python
import os
import nest_asyncio

from autogen import AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent, LLMConfig
from autogen.tools.experimental import BrowserUseTool

nest_asyncio.apply()
```

### Agent Configuration

Configure the agents for the interaction.

- `config_list` defines the LLM configurations, including the model and API key.
- [`UserProxyAgent`](/docs/api-reference/autogen/UserProxyAgent) simulates user inputs without requiring actual human interaction (set to `NEVER`).
- [`AssistantAgent`](/docs/api-reference/autogen/AssistantAgent) represents the AI agent, configured with the LLM settings.

<Tip>
[`Browser Use`](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use) supports the following models: [Supported Models](https://docs.browser-use.com/customize/supported-models#supported-models)

We had great experience with `OpenAI`, `Anthropic`, and `Gemini`. However, `DeepSeek` and `Ollama` haven't performed as well.
</Tip>

```python
llm_config = LLMConfig(api_type="openai", model="gpt-4o-mini", api_key=os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"])

user_proxy = UserProxyAgent(name="user_proxy", human_input_mode="NEVER")
with llm_config:
    assistant = AssistantAgent(name="assistant")
```

### Web Browsing with Browser Use


The [`BrowserUseTool`](/docs/api-reference/autogen/tools/experimental/BrowserUseTool) allows agents to interact with web pages—navigating, searching, and extracting information.

To see the agent's activity in real-time, set `headless` to `False` in the `browser_config`. If `True`, the browser runs in the background.

```python
browser_use_tool = BrowserUseTool(
    llm_config=llm_config,
    browser_config={"headless": False},
)

browser_use_tool.register_for_execution(user_proxy)
browser_use_tool.register_for_llm(assistant)
```

### Initiate Chat

Now, let’s run a task where the assistant searches Reddit for “AG2,” clicks the first post, and retrieves the first comment.

```python
result = user_proxy.initiate_chat(
    recipient=assistant,
    message="Go to Reddit, search for 'ag2' in the search bar, click on the first post and return the first comment.",
    max_turns=2,
)
```

```console
user_proxy (to assistant):

Go to Reddit, search for 'ag2' in the search bar, click on the first post and return the first comment.
