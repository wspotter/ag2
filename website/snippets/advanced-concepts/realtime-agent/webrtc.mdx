## **Why WebRTC?**
[WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) (Web Real-Time Communication) is a powerful technology for enabling direct peer-to-peer communication between browsers and servers. It was built with real-time audio, video, and data transfer in mind, making it an ideal choice for real-time voice applications. Here are some key benefits:

### **1. Low Latency**
[WebRTC's](https://webrtc.org/) peer-to-peer design minimizes latency, ensuring natural, fluid conversations.

### **2. Adaptive Quality**
[WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) dynamically adjusts audio quality based on network conditions, maintaining a seamless user experience even in suboptimal environments.

### **3. Secure by Design**
With encryption (DTLS and SRTP) baked into its architecture, [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) ensures secure communication between peers.

### **4. Widely Supported**
[WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) is supported by all major modern browsers, making it highly accessible for end users.

## **How It Works**

This example demonstrates using [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) to establish low-latency, real-time interactions with [OpenAI Realtime API with WebRTC](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/realtime-webrtc) from a web browser. Here's how it works:

![Realtime agent communication over WebRTC](/snippets/advanced-concepts/realtime-agent/img/webrtc_connection_diagram.png)

1. **Request an Ephemeral API Key**
   - The browser connects to your backend via [WebSockets](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/websockets/) to exchange configuration details, such as the ephemeral key and model information.
   - [WebSockets](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/websockets/) handle signaling to bootstrap the [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) session.
   - The browser requests a short-lived API key from your server.

2. **Generate an Ephemeral API Key**
   - Your backend generates an ephemeral key via the OpenAI REST API and returns it. These keys expire after one minute to enhance security.

3. **Initialize the WebRTC Connection**
   - **Audio Streaming**: The browser captures microphone input and streams it to OpenAI while playing audio responses via an `<audio>` element.
   - **DataChannel**: A `DataChannel` is established to send and receive events (e.g., function calls).
   - **Session Handshake**: The browser creates an SDP offer, sends it to OpenAI with the ephemeral key, and sets the remote SDP answer to finalize the connection.
   - The audio stream and events flow in real time, enabling interactive, low-latency conversations.

## **Example: Build a Voice-Enabled Weather Bot**
Let’s walk through a practical example of using [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) to create a voice-enabled weather bot.
<Note>You can find the full example [here](https://github.com/ag2ai/realtime-agent-over-webrtc/tree/main).</Note>

### **1. Clone the Repository**
Start by cloning the example project from GitHub:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ag2ai/realtime-agent-over-webrtc.git
cd realtime-agent-over-webrtc
```

### **2. Set Up Environment Variables**
Create a `OAI_CONFIG_LIST` file based on the provided `OAI_CONFIG_LIST_sample`:
```bash
cp OAI_CONFIG_LIST_sample OAI_CONFIG_LIST
```
In the `OAI_CONFIG_LIST` file, update the `api_key` with your OpenAI API key.

<Warning>
Supported key format

Currently WebRTC can be used only by API keys the begin with:

```
sk-proj
```

Other keys may result internal server error  (500) on OpenAI server. For more details see [this issue](https://community.openai.com/t/realtime-api-create-sessions-results-in-500-internal-server-error/1060964/5)

</Warning>

### (Optional) Create and Use a Virtual Environment
To avoid cluttering your global Python environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

### **3. Install Dependencies**
Install the required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **4. Start the Server**
Run the application with Uvicorn:
```bash
uvicorn realtime_over_webrtc.main:app --port 5050
```
When the server starts, you should see:
```bash
INFO:     Started server process [12345]
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:5050 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

### **5. Open the Application**
Navigate to [**localhost:5050/start-chat**](http://localhost:5050/start-chat) in your browser. The application will request microphone permissions to enable real-time voice interaction.

![Realtime agent chat](/snippets/advanced-concepts/realtime-agent/img/webrtc_chat.png)

### **6. Start Speaking**
To get started, simply speak into your microphone and ask a question. For example, you can say:

**"What's the weather like in Rome?"**

This initial question will activate the agent, and it will respond, showcasing its ability to understand and interact with you in real time.

## **Code review**

### WebRTC connection

A part of the [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) connection logic runs in browser,
and it is implemented by [AG2 javascript client library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ag2/client)

While you would usually use npm package in your project, for simplicity in this example we are
referencing [AG2 javascript client library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ag2/client) directly with:
```javascript
<script src="https://github.com/ag2ai/ag2-js-client/releases/download/v0.2.0/index.global.js"></script>
```
And code snippet to connect to the AG2 server is as follows:
```javascript
    const webRTC = new ag2client.WebRTC(socketUrl)
    await webRTC.connect();
```

### Server implementation

This server implementation uses [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) to set up a [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) and [WebSockets](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/websockets/) interaction, allowing clients to communicate with a chatbot powered by OpenAI's Realtime API. The server provides endpoints for a simple chat interface and real-time audio communication.

#### Create an app using FastAPI

First, initialize a [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) app instance to handle HTTP requests and [WebSocket](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/websockets/) connections.

```python
app = FastAPI()
```

This creates an app instance that will be used to manage both regular HTTP requests and real-time [WebSocket](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/websockets/) interactions.

#### Define the root endpoint for status

Next, define a root endpoint to verify that the server is running.

```python
@app.get("/", response_class=JSONResponse)
async def index_page():
    return {"message": "WebRTC AG2 Server is running!"}
```

When accessed, this endpoint responds with a simple status message indicating that the [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) server is up and running.

#### Set up static files and templates

Mount a directory for static files (e.g., CSS, JavaScript) and configure templates for rendering HTML.

```python
website_files_path = Path(__file__).parent / "website_files"

app.mount(
    "/static", StaticFiles(directory=website_files_path / "static"), name="static"
)

templates = Jinja2Templates(directory=website_files_path / "templates")
```

This ensures that static assets (like styling or scripts) can be served and that HTML templates can be rendered for dynamic responses.

#### Serve the chat interface page

Create an endpoint to serve the HTML page for the chat interface.

```python
@app.get("/start-chat/", response_class=HTMLResponse)
async def start_chat(request: Request):
    """Endpoint to return the HTML page for audio chat."""
    port = request.url.port
    return templates.TemplateResponse("chat.html", {"request": request, "port": port})
```

This endpoint serves the `chat.html` page and provides the port number in the template, which is used for [WebSockets](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/websockets/) connections.

#### Handle WebSocket connections for media streaming

Set up a [WebSocket](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/websockets/) endpoint to handle real-time interactions, including receiving audio streams and responding with OpenAI's model output.

```python
@app.websocket("/session")
async def handle_media_stream(websocket: WebSocket):
    """Handle WebSocket connections providing audio stream and OpenAI."""
    await websocket.accept()

    logger = getLogger("uvicorn.error")

    realtime_agent = RealtimeAgent(
        name="Weather Bot",
        system_message="Hello there! I am an AI voice assistant powered by Autogen and the OpenAI Realtime API. You can ask me about weather, jokes, or anything you can imagine. Start by saying 'How can I help you'?",
        llm_config=realtime_llm_config,
        websocket=websocket,
        logger=logger,
    )
```

This [WebSocket](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/websockets/) endpoint establishes a connection and creates a [**`RealtimeAgent`**](/docs/api-reference/autogen/agentchat/realtime/experimental/RealtimeAgent) that will manage interactions with OpenAI’s Realtime API. It also includes logging for monitoring the process.

#### Register and implement real-time functions

Define custom real-time functions that can be called from the client side, such as fetching weather data.

```python
    @realtime_agent.register_realtime_function(
        name="get_weather", description="Get the current weather"
    )
    def get_weather(location: Annotated[str, "city"]) -> str:
        logger.info(f"Checking the weather: {location}")
        return (
            "The weather is cloudy." if location == "Rome" else "The weather is sunny."
        )
```

Here, a weather-related function is registered with the [**`RealtimeAgent`**](/docs/api-reference/autogen/agentchat/realtime/experimental/RealtimeAgent). It responds with a simple weather message based on the input city.

#### Run the RealtimeAgent

Finally, run the [**`RealtimeAgent`**](/docs/api-reference/autogen/agentchat/realtime/experimental/RealtimeAgent) to start handling the [WebSocket](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/websockets/) interactions.

```python
    await realtime_agent.run()
```

This starts the agent's event loop, which listens for incoming messages and responds accordingly.
