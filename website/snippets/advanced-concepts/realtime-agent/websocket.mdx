## **How It Works**
At its core, the [**`WebSocketAudioAdapter`**](/docs/api-reference/autogen/agentchat/realtime/experimental/WebSocketAudioAdapter#websocketaudioadapter) leverages [WebSockets](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/websockets/) to handle real-time audio streaming. This means your browser becomes the communication bridge, sending audio packets to a server where a [**`RealtimeAgent`**](/docs/api-reference/autogen/agentchat/realtime/experimental/RealtimeAgent) agent processes them.

Here’s a quick overview of its components and how they fit together:

1. **WebSocket Connection**:
   - The adapter establishes a [WebSockets](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/websockets/) connection between the client (browser) and the server.
   - Audio packets are streamed in real time through this connection.

2. **Integration with FastAPI**:
   - Using Python's [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) framework, developers can easily set up endpoints for handling  [WebSockets](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/websockets/) traffic.

3. **Powered by Realtime Agents**:
   - The audio adapter integrates with an AI-powered [**`RealtimeAgent`**](/docs/api-reference/autogen/agentchat/realtime/experimental/RealtimeAgent), allowing the agent to process audio inputs and respond intelligently.

## **Key Features**
### **1. Simplified Setup**
Unlike [**`TwilioAudioAdapter`**](/docs/api-reference/autogen/agentchat/realtime/experimental/TwilioAudioAdapter#twilioaudioadapter), the [**`WebSocketAudioAdapter`**](/docs/api-reference/autogen/agentchat/realtime/experimental/WebSocketAudioAdapter#websocketaudioadapter) requires no phone numbers, no telephony configuration, and no external accounts. It's a plug-and-play solution.

### **2. Real-Time Performance**
By streaming audio over [WebSockets](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/websockets/), the adapter ensures low latency, making conversations feel natural and seamless.

### **3. Browser-Based**
Everything happens within the user's browser, meaning no additional software is required. This makes it ideal for web applications.

### **4. Flexible Integration**
Whether you're building a chatbot, a voice assistant, or an interactive application, the adapter can integrate easily with existing frameworks and AI systems.

## **Example: Build a Voice-Enabled Weather Bot**
Let’s walk through a practical example where we use the [**`WebSocketAudioAdapter`**](/docs/api-reference/autogen/agentchat/realtime/experimental/WebSocketAudioAdapter#websocketaudioadapter) to create a voice-enabled weather bot.
You can find the full example [here](https://github.com/ag2ai/realtime-agent-over-websockets/tree/main).

To run the demo example, follow these steps:

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ag2ai/realtime-agent-over-websockets.git
cd realtime-agent-over-websockets
```

### **2. Set Up Environment Variables**
Create a `OAI_CONFIG_LIST` file based on the provided `OAI_CONFIG_LIST_sample`:
```bash
cp OAI_CONFIG_LIST_sample OAI_CONFIG_LIST
```
In the OAI_CONFIG_LIST file, update the `api_key` to your OpenAI and/or Gemini API keys.

### (Optional) Create and use a virtual environment

To reduce cluttering your global Python environment on your machine, you can create a virtual environment. On your command line, enter:

```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

### **3. Install Dependencies**
Install the required Python packages using `pip`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **4. Start the Server**
Run the application with Uvicorn:
```bash
uvicorn realtime_over_websockets.main:app --port 5050
```

After you start the server you should see your application running in the logs:

```bash
INFO:     Started server process [64425]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:5050 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

### Ready to Chat? 🚀
Now you can simply open [**localhost:5050/start-chat**](http://localhost:5050/start-chat) in your browser, and dive into an interactive conversation with the [**`RealtimeAgent`**](/docs/api-reference/autogen/agentchat/realtime/experimental/RealtimeAgent)! 🎤✨

![Realtime agent chat](/snippets/advanced-concepts/realtime-agent/img/websocket_chat.png)

To get started, simply speak into your microphone and ask a question. For example, you can say:

**"What's the weather like in Seattle?"**

This initial question will activate the agent, and it will respond, showcasing its ability to understand and interact with you in real time.

## Code review
Let’s dive in and break down how this example works—from setting up the server to handling real-time audio streaming with [WebSockets](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/websockets/).

### **Set Up the FastAPI app**
We use [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) to serve the chat interface and handle WebSocket connections. A key part is configuring the server to load and render HTML templates dynamically for the user interface.

- **Template Loading**: Use `Jinja2Templates` to load `chat.html` from the `templates` directory. The template is dynamically rendered with variables like the server's `port`.
- **Static Files**: Serve assets (e.g., JavaScript, CSS) from the `static` directory.

```python
app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/", response_class=JSONResponse)
async def index_page() -> dict[str, str]:
    return {"message": "WebSocket Audio Stream Server is running!"}


website_files_path = Path(__file__).parent / "website_files"

app.mount(
    "/static", StaticFiles(directory=website_files_path / "static"), name="static"
)

templates = Jinja2Templates(directory=website_files_path / "templates")


@app.get("/start-chat/", response_class=HTMLResponse)
async def start_chat(request: Request) -> HTMLResponse:
    """Endpoint to return the HTML page for audio chat."""
    port = request.url.port
    return templates.TemplateResponse("chat.html", {"request": request, "port": port})
```

### Defining the WebSocket Endpoint

The `/media-stream` WebSocket route is where real-time audio interaction is processed and streamed to the AI assistant. Let’s break it down step-by-step:

1. **Accept the WebSocket Connection**
   The WebSocket connection is established when a client connects to `/media-stream`. Using `await websocket.accept()`, we ensure the connection is live and ready for communication.

```python
@app.websocket("/media-stream")
async def handle_media_stream(websocket: WebSocket) -> None:
    """Handle WebSocket connections providing audio stream and OpenAI."""
    await websocket.accept()
```

2. **Initialize Logging**
   A logger instance (`getLogger("uvicorn.error")`) is set up to monitor and debug the server's activities, helping track events during the connection and interaction process.

```python
    logger = getLogger("uvicorn.error")
```
3. **Set Up the `WebSocketAudioAdapter`**
   The [**`WebSocketAudioAdapter`**](/docs/api-reference/autogen/agentchat/realtime/experimental/WebSocketAudioAdapter#websocketaudioadapter) bridges the client’s audio stream with the [**`RealtimeAgent`**](/docs/api-reference/autogen/agentchat/realtime/experimental/RealtimeAgent). It streams audio data over [WebSockets](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/websockets/) in real time, ensuring seamless communication between the browser and the agent.

```python
    audio_adapter = WebSocketAudioAdapter(websocket, logger=logger)
```

4. **Configure the Realtime Agent**
   The `RealtimeAgent` is the AI assistant driving the interaction. Key parameters include:
   - **Name**: The agent identity, here called `"Weather Bot"`.
   - **System Message**: System message for the agent.
   - **Language Model Configuration**: Defined by `realtime_llm_config` for LLM settings.
   - **Audio Adapter**: Connects the [**`WebSocketAudioAdapter`**](/docs/api-reference/autogen/agentchat/realtime/experimental/WebSocketAudioAdapter#websocketaudioadapter) for handling audio.
   - **Logger**: Logs the agent's activities for better observability.

```python
    realtime_agent = RealtimeAgent(
        name="Weather Bot",
        system_message="Hello there! I am an AI voice assistant powered by Autogen and the OpenAI Realtime API. You can ask me about weather, jokes, or anything you can imagine. Start by saying 'How can I help you'?",
        llm_config=realtime_llm_config,
        audio_adapter=audio_adapter,
        logger=logger,
    )
```

5. **Define a Custom Realtime Function**
   The `get_weather` function is registered as a realtime callable function. When the user asks about the weather, the agent can call the function to get an accurate weather report and respond based on the provided information:
   - Returns `"The weather is cloudy."` for `"Seattle"`.
   - Returns `"The weather is sunny."` for other locations.

```python
    @realtime_agent.register_realtime_function(  # type: ignore [misc]
        name="get_weather", description="Get the current weather"
    )
    def get_weather(location: Annotated[str, "city"]) -> str:
        return (
            "The weather is cloudy."
            if location == "Seattle"
            else "The weather is sunny."
        )
```

6. **Run the Realtime Agent**
   The `await realtime_agent.run()` method starts the agent, handling incoming audio streams, processing user queries, and responding in real time.

Here is the full code for the `/media-stream` endpoint:

```python
@app.websocket("/media-stream")
async def handle_media_stream(websocket: WebSocket) -> None:
    """Handle WebSocket connections providing audio stream and OpenAI."""
    await websocket.accept()

    logger = getLogger("uvicorn.error")

    audio_adapter = WebSocketAudioAdapter(websocket, logger=logger)

    realtime_agent = RealtimeAgent(
        name="Weather Bot",
        system_message="Hello there! I am an AI voice assistant powered by Autogen and the OpenAI Realtime API. You can ask me about weather, jokes, or anything you can imagine. Start by saying 'How can I help you'?",
        llm_config=realtime_llm_config,
        audio_adapter=audio_adapter,
        logger=logger,
    )

    @realtime_agent.register_realtime_function(  # type: ignore [misc]
        name="get_weather", description="Get the current weather"
    )
    def get_weather(location: Annotated[str, "city"]) -> str:
        return (
            "The weather is cloudy."
            if location == "Seattle"
            else "The weather is sunny."
        )

    await realtime_agent.run()
```
