## Create a virtual environment (optional)

When installing AG2 locally, we recommend using a virtual environment for the installation. This will ensure that the dependencies for AG2 are isolated from the rest of your system.

## Install AG2

AG2 requires **Python version >= 3.9, < 3.14**. It can be installed from pip:

```bash
pip install ag2[openai]
```

<Tip>
If you have been using `autogen` or `pyautogen`, all you need to do is upgrade it using:
```bash
pip install -U autogen[openai]
```
or
```bash
pip install -U pyautogen[openai]
```
as `pyautogen`, `autogen`, and `ag2` are aliases for the same PyPI package.
</Tip>

  <Info> `openai>=1` is required. </Info>

## Install Docker for Code Execution

We recommend using Docker for code execution.
To install Docker, follow the instructions for your operating system on the [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

A simple example of how to use Docker for code execution is shown below:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from autogen import UserProxyAgent
from autogen.coding import DockerCommandLineCodeExecutor

work_dir = Path("coding")
work_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)

with DockerCommandLineCodeExecutor(work_dir=work_dir) as code_executor:
    user_proxy = UserProxyAgent(
        name="user_proxy",
        code_execution_config={"executor": code_executor},
    )
```

To learn more about code executors, see the [code executors tutorial](/docs/tutorial/code-executors).

You might have seen a different way of defining the executors without creating the
executor object, please refer to FAQ for this [legacy code executor](/docs/faq/FAQ#legacy-code-executor).
