## Conclusion

The [`DeepResearchAgent`](/docs/api-reference/autogen/agents/experimental/DeepResearchAgent) within the AG2 framework helps automate complex research tasks by gathering information from different online sources. It breaks down big questions into smaller tasks and works through them one by one. After completing all the steps, the agent creates a detailed summary, making it easier for users to handle research challenges and find useful insights quickly.
