**TL;DR:**
- Build a real-time voice application using [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) and connect it with the [**`RealtimeAgent`**](/docs/api-reference/autogen/agentchat/realtime/experimental/RealtimeAgent). [Demo implementation](https://github.com/ag2ai/realtime-agent-over-webrtc).
- **Optimized for Real-Time Interactions**: Experience seamless voice communication with minimal latency and enhanced reliability.

# **Realtime Voice Applications with WebRTC**

In our [previous blog post](/docs/blog/2025-01-08-RealtimeAgent-over-websocket), we introduced the [**`WebSocketAudioAdapter`**](/docs/api-reference/autogen/agentchat/realtime/experimental/WebSocketAudioAdapter#websocketaudioadapter), a simple way to stream real-time audio using [WebSockets](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/websockets/). While effective, [WebSockets](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/websockets/) can face challenges with quality and reliability in high-latency or network-variable scenarios. Enter [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/).

Today, we’re excited to showcase the integration with [OpenAI Realtime API with WebRTC](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/realtime-webrtc), leveraging WebRTC’s peer-to-peer communication capabilities to provide a robust, low-latency, high-quality audio streaming experience directly from the browser.

## **Conclusion**
New integration of [OpenAI Realtime API with WebRTC](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/realtime-webrtc) unlocks the full potential of [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) for real-time voice applications. With its low latency, adaptive quality, and secure communication, it’s the perfect tool for building interactive, voice-enabled applications.

Try it today and take your voice applications to the next level!
