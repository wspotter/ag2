title: Hooks
---

API Reference: [ConversableAgent.register_hook](/docs/api-reference/autogen/ConversableAgent#register-hook)

Hooks are a means to update/review agent state before replying, and messages before sending and replying.

You can define functions and associate them with these hooks and they will execute at certain points in the workflow, see the [initiate_chat](./initiate-chat) page to see where these occur (blue circles).

### How to register a hook

Use the [ConversableAgent.register_hook](/docs/api-reference/autogen/ConversableAgent#register-hook) method to register a function for a hook using the hook's string name.

```python
my_agent.register_hook("THE_HOOK_NAME", my_function)
```

There are **four hooks** available on a ConversableAgent, let's look at them and how you use them.

### 1. "process_message_before_send"

This hook is the only hook not in ConversableAgent's [generate_reply](./generate-reply) method and is designed to intercept a message before it is sent to another agent.

You can change the message with the hook and the change will be permanent. This is because this hook is called before a message is displayed or added to the message list.

Signature:
```python
def your_function_name(
    sender: ConversableAgent,
    message: Union[dict[str, Any], str],
    recipient: Agent,
    silent: bool) -> Union[dict[str, Any], str]:
```

Let's look at how we could prepend a message with who is sending the message (sender) and to whom it's going (recipient).

In this example, our `Mike` agent will have this hook registered, so all their messages will have this text added.

```python
from autogen import ConversableAgent, Agent, LLMConfig
from typing import Any, Union

llm_config = LLMConfig(model="gpt-4o-mini", api_type="openai")

with llm_config:
  agent_mike = ConversableAgent(name="Mike")
  agent_bob = ConversableAgent(name="Bob")

# Our function associated with the hook
def update_message_before_send(
    sender: ConversableAgent,
    message: Union[dict[str, Any], str],
    recipient: Agent,
    silent: bool) -> Union[dict[str, Any], str]:

    if isinstance(message, dict):
        msg_text = message.get("content", message)
    else:
        msg_text = message

    # Here we prepend the message with "<Mike said to Bob>"
    msg_text = f"<{sender.name} said to {recipient.name}> " + msg_text

    if isinstance(message, dict):
        message["content"] = msg_text
    else:
        message = msg_text

    # Return the updated message, this will be a permanent change to the message
    return message

# Register the hook with the Mike agent
agent_mike.register_hook("process_message_before_send", update_message_before_send)

# Run the chat
chat_result = agent_mike.initiate_chat(
    recipient=agent_bob,
    message="Hello Bob, tell me a joke!",
    max_turns=2
)

print(chat_result.chat_history)
```

Here's the output, you can see Mike's messages (including the initial message) now have our text prepended and the chat history has the permanently changed messages:

```console
Mike (to Bob):

<Mike said to Bob> Hello Bob, tell me a joke!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>>>> USING AUTO REPLY...
Bob (to Mike):

Sure, here’s a joke for you:

Why did the scarecrow win an award?

Because he was outstanding in his field!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>>>> USING AUTO REPLY...
Mike (to Bob):

<Mike said to Bob> That's a good one, Bob! Here's one for you:

What do you call fake spaghetti?

An impasta!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>>>> USING AUTO REPLY...
Bob (to Mike):

:Bob
Haha, that's a great one, Mike! How about this:

Why don’t skeletons fight each other?

They don’t have the guts!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chat History:
[
  {
    "content": "<Mike said to Bob> Hello Bob, tell me a joke!",
    "role": "assistant",
    "name": "Mike"
  },
  {
    "content": "Sure, here\u2019s a joke for you:\n\nWhy did the scarecrow win an award?\n\nBecause he was outstanding in his field!",
    "role": "user",
    "name": "Bob"
  },
  {
    "content": "<Mike said to Bob> That's a good one, Bob! Here's one for you:\n\nWhat do you call fake spaghetti?\n\nAn impasta!",
    "role": "assistant",
    "name": "Mike"
  },
  {
    "content": ":Bob  \nHaha, that's a great one, Mike! How about this:\n\nWhy don\u2019t skeletons fight each other?\n\nThey don\u2019t have the guts!",
    "role": "user",
    "name": "Bob"
  }
]
```

This is a good hook if you need to edit the message before it is added to the messages list, such as for redacting text.


### 2. "update_agent_state"

The first of three hooks that run in the [ConversableAgent.generate_reply](/docs/api-reference/autogen/ConversableAgent#generate-reply) method before the reply functions are evaluated.

This hook is designed to be used to update an agent's state, typically their system message, before replying.

As the system message is a key message for an LLM to consider, it's useful to be able to make sure that pertinent information is there.

A couple of examples of where it is used:
- DocAgent to update the internal summary agent's system message with the context from the ingestions and queries.
- Swarms to hide/show conditional hand-offs.

Signature:
```python
def my_update_function(
    agent: ConversableAgent,
    messages: list[dict[str, Any]]
    ) -> None:
```

In the following example we will update an agent's system message to have the current date in it.

```python
from autogen import ConversableAgent, LLMConfig
from typing import Any

llm_config = LLMConfig(model="gpt-4o-mini", api_type="openai")

calendar_prompt = ("You are a calendar agent who answers questions on the date and day.\n"
                   "The current date is: [CURRENT_DATE]\n"
                   "The current day is: [CURRENT_DAY]"
)

with llm_config:
  # Our calendar agent, we won't set a system_message here as we will set it with the hook
  agent_calendar = ConversableAgent(name="Calendar_Agent")
  agent_bob = ConversableAgent(name="Bob")

# Our function to update the agent's system message, this will be attached to the hook
def update_my_agent_state(
    agent: ConversableAgent,
    messages: list[dict[str, Any]]
    ) -> None:

    from datetime import datetime
    now = datetime.now()

    # Format the date as string (e.g., "2025-02-25")
    current_date = now.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")

    # Get day of week as a string (e.g., "Tuesday")
    day_of_week = now.strftime("%A")

    # Update the agent's system message using the prompt template and the current date and day
    agent.update_system_message(calendar_prompt.replace("[CURRENT_DATE]", current_date).replace("[CURRENT_DAY]", day_of_week))

# Register the hook with the Calendar agent
agent_calendar.register_hook("update_agent_state", update_my_agent_state)

chat_result = agent_bob.initiate_chat(
    recipient=agent_calendar,
    message="What's the date today and what's the day?",
    max_turns=1
)

print(f"Calendar_Agent's system message is:\n{agent_calendar.system_message}")
```

We can see from the output that `Calendar_Agent` is able to provide the current date and time. Furthermore, their system message is updated.

```console
Bob (to Calendar_Agent):

What's the date today and what's the day?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>>>> USING AUTO REPLY...
Calendar_Agent (to Bob):

Today's date is February 24, 2025, and it's a Monday.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Calendar_Agent's system message is:
You are a calendar agent who answers questions on the date and day.
The current date is: 2025-02-24
The current day is: Monday
```

### 3. "process_last_received_message"

This is the second of the three hooks that run in the [ConversableAgent.generate_reply](/docs/api-reference/autogen/ConversableAgent#generate-reply) method before the reply functions are evaluated.

This hook is used to process the last message in the messages list (as opposed to all messages, handled by the next hook).

If the last message is a function call or is "exit" then it will not execute the associated function.

Changing the message will result in permanent changes to the chat messages of the agent with the hook, but not other agents. So, changes to the messages will be present in future [generate_reply](/docs/api-reference/autogen/ConversableAgent#generate-reply) calls for the agent with the hook, but not other agent's calls to [generate_reply](/docs/api-reference/autogen/ConversableAgent#generate-reply).

A couple of examples of where it is used:
- The [Teachability capability](/docs/api-reference/autogen/agentchat/contrib/capabilities/teachability/Teachability) appends any relevant memos to the last message.
- The [Vision capability](/docs/api-reference/autogen/agentchat/contrib/capabilities/vision_capability/VisionCapability) will update the last message if it contains an image with a caption for the image using an LLM call.

Signature:
```python
def my_processing_function(
    content: Union[str, list[dict[str, Any]]]
    ) -> str:
```

Here's an example that changes any instances of the word "blue" to "red" in the last message.

```python
from autogen import ConversableAgent, LLMConfig
from typing import Any, Union

llm_config = LLMConfig(model="gpt-4o-mini", api_type="openai")

with llm_config:
  agent_scientist = ConversableAgent(name="scientist")
  agent_bob = ConversableAgent(name="Bob")

# Our function for the hook, to replace "blue" with "red" in the last received message
def replace_blue_with_red(
    message: Union[str, list[dict[str, Any]]]
    ) -> str:

    if isinstance(message, list):
        msg_text = message[-1].get("content")
    else:
        msg_text = message

    # Replace "blue" with "red" in the message
    msg_text = msg_text.replace("blue", "red")

    return msg_text

# Register the hook with the Scientist agent
agent_scientist.register_hook("process_last_received_message", replace_blue_with_red)

chat_result = agent_bob.initiate_chat(
    recipient=agent_scientist,
    message="In one sentence, why is the sky blue?",
    max_turns=1
)

print(f"Chat Result first message:\n{chat_result.chat_history[0]}\n\n")
print(f"Scientist agent's first chat message with Bob:\n{agent_scientist.chat_messages[agent_bob][0]}")
```
We can see from the output that although the question asks why the sky is blue, it is updated and changed to red before the LLM responds.

We can see the main chat messages are unchanged but the Scientist's chat history with Bob shows that the question was changed to red.

```console
Bob (to scientist):

In one sentence, why is the sky blue?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>>>> USING AUTO REPLY...
scientist (to Bob):

The sky appears red during sunrise or sunset due to the scattering of sunlight by the atmosphere, which causes shorter blue wavelengths to dissipate and allows longer red wavelengths to dominate.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chat Result first message:
{'content': 'In one sentence, why is the sky blue?', 'role': 'assistant', 'name': 'Bob'}


Scientist agent's first chat message with Bob:
{'content': 'In one sentence, why is the sky red?', 'role': 'user', 'name': 'Bob'}
```

### 4. "process_all_messages_before_reply"

The final hook that runs in the [ConversableAgent.generate_reply](/docs/api-reference/autogen/ConversableAgent#generate-reply) method before the reply functions are evaluated.

This hook is used to work on all messages before replying.

The changes to these messages will be used for the replying but will not persist beyond the [generate_reply](/docs/api-reference/autogen/ConversableAgent#generate-reply) call.

An example of the use of this hook is the [TransformMessages](/docs/api-reference/autogen/agentchat/contrib/capabilities/transform_messages/TransformMessages) capability where it carries out all transforms (such as limiting the number messages, filtering sensitive information, truncating individual messages) on messages before an agent replies.

Signature:
```python
def your_function_name(
    messages: list[dict[str, Any]]
    ) -> list[dict[str, Any]]:
```

Here's an example that adds the agent's name to the start of each message.

```python
from autogen import ConversableAgent, LLMConfig
from typing import Any
import json

llm_config = LLMConfig(model="gpt-4o-mini", api_type="openai")

with llm_config:
  agent_mike = ConversableAgent(name="Mike", system_message="You are a comedian.")
  agent_bob = ConversableAgent(name="Bob", system_message="You are a comedian.")

# Our function for the hook, to prepend the agent's name on each message
def prepend_name(
    messages: list[dict[str, Any]]
    ) -> list[dict[str, Any]]:

    for message in messages:
        if "name" in message:
            message["content"] = f"{message['name']} said: {message['content']}"

    # Print out the updated messages so we can see what has changed before the agent replies
    print(f"\n[Updated messages]:")
    print(json.dumps(messages, indent=2))
    print()

    return messages

# Register the hook with the Mike agent
agent_mike.register_hook("process_all_messages_before_reply", prepend_name)

chat_result = agent_bob.initiate_chat(
    recipient=agent_mike,
    message="Let's tell some jokes!",
    max_turns=2
)

print(f"Chat Result messages:\n{json.dumps(chat_result.chat_history, indent=2)}\n\n")
```

From the output we can observe:
- The messages are updated before Mike replies.
- The ChatResult's chat history does not include these temporary changes.
- LLMs have an inclination to mimic formats used, so we can see the LLM added ":Mike  \nMike said:" to the last message it created (this wasn't created by our hook).

```console
Bob (to Mike):

Let's tell some jokes!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Updated messages]:
[
  {
    "content": "Bob said: Let's tell some jokes!",
    "role": "user",
    "name": "Bob"
  }
]

Oh, that’s a classic! How about we dive into the world of tech? Here’s one for you:
