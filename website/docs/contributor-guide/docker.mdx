title: Docker for Development
---

For developers contributing to the AG2 project, we offer a specialized devcontainer environment. This setup is designed to streamline the development process, ensuring that all contributors work within a consistent and well-equipped environment.

## AG2 Devcontainer

- **Purpose**: The devcontainer is tailored for contributors to the AG2 project. It includes a suite of tools and configurations that aid in the development and testing of new features or fixes.
- **Usage**: This image is recommended for developers who intend to contribute code or documentation to AG2.
- **Forking the Project**: It's advisable to fork the AG2 GitHub project to your own repository. This allows you to make changes in a separate environment without affecting the main project.
- **Submitting Pull Requests**: Once your changes are ready, submit a pull request from your branch to the upstream AG2 GitHub project for review and integration. For more details on contributing, see the [AG2 Contributing](/docs/contributor-guide/contributing) page.

## Developing AutoGen with Devcontainers

1. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and select `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`.
3. Select the desired python environment and wait for the container to build.
4. Once the container is built, you can start developing AutoGen.

## Developing Autogen with Codespaces

Provided devcontainer files can be used with GitHub Codespaces. To use the devcontainer with GitHub Codespaces, follow the steps below:

1. Open the AG2 repository in GitHub.
2. Click on the `Code` button and select `Open with Codespaces`.
3. Select the desired python environment and wait for the container to build.
4. Once the container is built, you can start developing AutoGen.
