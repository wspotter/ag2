## Setting up LLM Keys

If you are contributing to the AG2 project, you will need an LLM key depending on the submodule you are working on.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Using OAI_CONFIG_LIST">
    AG2 uses an environment variable called `OAI_CONFIG_LIST` in JSON format to store the LLM keys. `OAI_CONFIG_LIST` is a list of dictionaries where each dictionary contains the following keys:
        - `model`(required): The name of the OpenAI/LLM model.
        - `api_key`(optional): The API key for the OpenAI/LLM model.
        - `api_type`(optional): The type of the API key. It is used for non-OpenAI LLMs.
        - `api_version`(optional): The version of the API key. It is used for Azure API.
        - `base_url`(optional): The base URL for the OpenAI/LLM model.
        - `tags`(optional): A list of tags for the OpenAI/LLM model which can be used for filtering.

    Following is an example of the `OAI_CONFIG_LIST` in JSON format which consists of two OpenAI models and a gemini model:
    ```bash
    [
        {
            "model": "gpt-4o",
            "api_key": "<your_api_key>",
            "tags": ["gpt-4o", "tool", "vision"]
        },
        {
            "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
            "api_key": "<your_api_key>",
            "tags": ["gpt-4o-mini", "tool", "vision"]
        },
        {
            "api_type": "google",
            "model": "gemini-pro",
            "api_key": "<your_gemini_api_key>",
        }
    ]
    ```

    Further, this `OAI_CONFIG_LIST` can be set in two ways:
    <Tabs>
        <Tab title="As environment variable">
            Simply set the `OAI_CONFIG_LIST` environment variable in your terminal:
            ```bash
            export OAI_CONFIG_LIST='[{"api_type": "openai", "model": "gpt-4o","api_key": "<your_api_key>","tags": ["gpt-4o", "tool", "vision"]},{"api_type": "openai", "model": "gpt-4o-mini","api_key": "<your_api_key>","tags": ["gpt-4o-mini", "tool", "vision"]},{"api_type": "google", "model": "gemini-pro","api_key": "<your_gemini_api_key>",}]'
            ```
        </Tab>
        <Tab title="As file">
            Or you can save the `OAI_CONFIG_LIST` in a file and set the path of the file as an environment variable.
            For example, let's say you have saved the `OAI_CONFIG_LIST` in a file called `OAI_CONFIG_LIST.json` at the root of the project. You can set the `OAI_CONFIG_LIST` environment variable as follows:
            ```bash
            export OAI_CONFIG_LIST="/path/to/OAI_CONFIG_LIST.json"
            ```
        </Tab>
    </Tabs>

        </Tip>
    </div>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Using LLM keys directly">
    Alternatively, you can set up the LLM keys directly as environment variables. Following is an example of setting up the Gemini api key as an environment variable:
    ```bash
    export GEMINI_API_KEY="<your_api_key>"
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


## Setting up the Development Environment

To contribute to the AG2 project, AG2 provides three different methods to set up the development environment:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Dev Containers">
    1. Setup the necessary LLM keys as mentioned above in your terminal.
    2. Clone the AG2 repository and cd into the repository.
    3. Open the project in Visual Studio Code by running the following command from the root of the repository:
        ```bash
        code .
        ```
    4. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and select `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`.
    5. Select the desired python environment and wait for the container to build.
    6. Once the container is built, you can start developing AG2.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Codespaces">
    1. Open the AG2 repository on GitHub and fork the repository.
    2. Navigate to Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Codespaces.
    3. Add the necessary LLM keys as mentioned above by clicking on the `New repository secret` button.
    4. Navigate back to the forked repository.
    5. Click on the `Code` button and select `Open with Codespaces`.
    6. Once the container is built, you can start developing AG2.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Virtual Environment">
    1. Setup the necessary LLM keys as mentioned above in your terminal.
    2. Fork the AG2 repository and clone the forked repository.
    3. Create a virtual environment by running the following command from the root of the repository:
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        ```
    4. Activate the virtual environment by running the following command:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    5. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
        ```bash
        pip install -e ".[dev]" && pre-commit install
        ```
    6. Once the dependencies are installed, you can start developing AG2.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


## Verifying the Development Environment

To make sure that we have set up the development environment correctly, we can run the pre-commit hooks and tests.

To run the pre-commit hooks, run the following command:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

To run the non-llm tests, run the following command:

```bash
bash scripts/test-core-skip-llm.sh
```
