title: Escalation
---

The Escalation Pattern is a resource-efficient approach to task handling where simpler, less resource-intensive agents handle tasks first, with more capable (but potentially more expensive) agents only being engaged when necessary.

### Key Characteristics

![Escalation Pattern](./assets/escalation.jpeg)

The Escalation Pattern optimizes resource usage by intelligently routing tasks to appropriate agents based on complexity and agent capabilities. At its core, this pattern recognizes that not all queries require the same level of expertise or computational resources to address effectively. By establishing a hierarchy of agents with increasing capabilities and costs, the system can balance efficiency and quality.

* **Progressive Capability**: Tasks start with basic agents and escalate through progressively more capable agents only when needed.

* **Resource Efficiency**: Simpler, less expensive agents handle straightforward tasks, while more powerful agents are reserved for complex problems.

* **Clear Escalation Criteria**: Well-defined confidence thresholds and structured responses determine when to escalate to the next level.

* **Context Preservation**: All context and query information is maintained throughout the escalation process.

* **Graceful Degradation**: System handles varying complexity levels efficiently, providing the best available answer.

### Information Flow

![Escalation Flow](./assets/escalation_flow.jpeg)

The flow of information in the Escalation Pattern follows a deliberate path designed to maximize efficiency while ensuring that queries receive appropriate attention. Each query undergoes evaluation at multiple levels if necessary, with decisions made based on structured confidence assessments rather than subjective impressions. This systematic approach ensures consistent handling of queries and optimal resource allocation.

* **Query Reception**: The triage agent receives the user query and routes it to the basic agent.

* **Confidence Assessment**: Each agent evaluates the query and provides a structured response with a confidence score.

* **Escalation Decision**:
   - If confidence is below threshold (typically < 8/10), escalate to the next agent level
   - If confidence is above threshold, return the response to the user

* **Context Tracking**: Context variables track each agent's confidence score, escalation count, and reasons.

* **Result Delivery**: The final answer is returned through the triage agent to the user.

### Implementation

Implementing the Escalation Pattern requires careful design of both the agent architecture and the communication protocol between agents. The implementation leverages structured data formats and explicit confidence reporting to make escalation decisions transparent and consistent. By using the Swarm orchestration engine, the pattern can be implemented with minimal custom code while maintaining robust escalation logic and context preservation.

* **Structured Response Format**: A Pydantic model (`ConsideredResponse`) captures answer, confidence, reasoning, and escalation information.

* **Confidence Thresholds**: Agents escalate queries when their confidence falls below a defined threshold (8/10).

* **Agent-Specific Context Variables**: Each agent's confidence and escalation decisions are tracked independently.

* **OnContextCondition**: Transitions between agents are triggered by evaluating context variables.

* **Tool Functions**: Specialized tool functions process structured responses and manage escalation logic.

  "response": {
    "answer": "We consider a non‐stationary K‐armed bandit problem where the reward distribution of each arm i ∈ {1, …, K} at time t is affected by an unobserved state sₜ of a hidden Markov model (HMM). In our approach the underlying state sₜ governs the reward distribution parameters (for example, the mean μ_{i,sₜ}) so that when the HMM transitions the reward distributions may shift. To handle non‐stationarity smoothly, we propose a modified Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm that uses exponential discounting together with an adaptive bonus term reflecting both the uncertainty due to limited data and additional variance that may arise when the hidden state changes.\n\nAssume we have a discount factor γ ∈ (0, 1) that weights more recent observations higher. For each arm i, at time t we maintain:\n\n1. A discounted count (or effective number of pulls):\n\n  Nᵢ(t) = Σₛ₌₁ᵗ γ^(t-s) · 𝟙{Aₛ = i}\n\n2. A discounted sum of observed rewards:\n\n  Sᵢ(t) = Σₛ₌₁ᵗ γ^(t-s) · rₛ · 𝟙{Aₛ = i}\n\n3. A discounted sample mean (reward estimate):\n\n  μ̂ᵢ(t) = Sᵢ(t)/Nᵢ(t)                 (1)\n\n4. An adaptive estimate of the variance that may be influenced by regime shifts. For example, one can update the empirical variance vᵢ(t) recursively (only when arm i is played):\n\n  vᵢ(t) = γ · vᵢ(t-1) + 𝟙{Aₜ = i} · [rₜ - μ̂ᵢ(t-1)]²      (2)\n\nwhere vᵢ(t) can be interpreted as capturing additional uncertainty (i.e. volatility) potentially induced by the hidden state transitions.\n\nThen, we propose that the UCB index for arm i at time t be defined as:\n\n  UCBᵢ(t) = μ̂ᵢ(t) + c · √[ (1 + vᵢ(t)) · ln(t) / Nᵢ(t) ]      (3)\n\nHere, c > 0 is a tuning parameter that controls the balance between exploration and exploitation. The term (1 + vᵢ(t)) serves as a multiplicative factor on the exploration bonus that enlarges the confidence bounds when higher variance (i.e. uncertainty due to possible HMM transitions) is detected. \n\nThe overall decision rule is to select at time t the arm i maximizing UCBᵢ(t).\n\nHow Does This Approach Address Non-Stationarity Better than Thompson Sampling with a Sliding Window?\n\n• Discounting Versus Hard Cutoffs: Thompson Sampling with a sliding window discards older observations completely. In contrast, our discounting approach continuously down-weights past data which allows a smooth transition and rapid adaptation to new regimes, while still leveraging all available information.\n\n• Variance Awareness: Including an adaptive variance estimate vᵢ(t) in the bonus term makes the algorithm more sensitive to sudden changes induced by the HMM’s transitions. When a regime change occurs, vᵢ(t) increases, thereby increasing the exploration bonus and prompting the algorithm to gather more data in the current regime.

# Mathematical Model for Non-Stationary Multi-Armed Bandit Problem with HMM

## Problem Formulation

We consider a non-stationary multi-armed bandit problem with $K$ arms, where the reward distributions shift according to a hidden Markov model (HMM). Let's define the key components:

- Let $S = \{s_1, s_2, ..., s_M\}$ be the set of $M$ possible hidden states
- At each time step $t$, the environment is in a hidden state $z_t \in S$
- The transition probability matrix $P$ where $P_{ij} = P(z_{t+1} = s_j | z_t = s_i)$
- For each arm $a \in \{1, 2, ..., K\}$ and each state $s \in S$, there exists a reward distribution $\mathcal{R}_{a,s}$ with mean $\mu_{a,s}$ and variance $\sigma^2_{a,s}$
- At time $t$, pulling arm $a_t$ yields a reward $r_t \sim \mathcal{R}_{a_t,z_t}$

## Proposed Approach: HMM-UCB Algorithm

I propose a novel modification to the UCB algorithm called HMM-UCB that incorporates state inference and transition dynamics.

### 1. State Inference Component

Use a Bayesian approach to maintain a belief state $b_t$ over the hidden states:

$b_t(s) = P(z_t = s | a_1, r_1, ..., a_{t-1}, r_{t-1})$

After observing reward $r_t$ from action $a_t$, update the belief using Bayes' rule:

$b_{t+1}(s_j) = \frac{\sum_{s_i \in S} b_t(s_i) P_{ij} f_{a_t, s_j}(r_t)}{\sum_{s_k \in S} \sum_{s_i \in S} b_t(s_i) P_{ik} f_{a_t, s_k}(r_t)}$

where $f_{a,s}(r)$ is the probability density function of reward $r$ from arm $a$ in state $s$.

### 2. Dynamic Parameter Estimation

For each arm $a$ and state $s$, maintain the following statistics:
- $N_{a,s}(t)$: Effective number of pulls of arm $a$ in state $s$ up to time $t$
- $\hat{\mu}_{a,s}(t)$: Estimated mean reward of arm $a$ in state $s$

Update these estimates using state-dependent weighted averages:

$N_{a,s}(t) = \sum_{\tau=1}^{t-1} \lambda^{t-\tau-1} \mathbb{I}\{a_\tau = a\} b_{\tau}(s)$

$\hat{\mu}_{a,s}(t) = \frac{\sum_{\tau=1}^{t-1} \lambda^{t-\tau-1} \mathbb{I}\{a_\tau = a\} b_{\tau}(s) r_\tau}{N_{a,s}(t)}$

where $\lambda \in (0,1]$ is a discount factor that handles natural non-stationarity within each state.

### 3. UCB Action Selection Formula

The HMM-UCB algorithm selects actions according to:

$a_t = \arg\max_{a \in \{1,2,...,K\}} \sum_{s \in S} b_t(s) \left[ \hat{\mu}_{a,s}(t) + \alpha \sqrt{\frac{\log(t)}{\max(N_{a,s}(t), 1)}} + \beta H(b_t, s, a) \right]$

where:
- $\alpha > 0$ is an exploration parameter
- $\beta > 0$ controls the state information gain importance
- $H(b_t, s, a)$ is an information gain term that measures how much pulling arm $a$ would reduce uncertainty about state $s$:

$H(b_t, s, a) = \mathbb{E}_{r \sim \mathcal{R}_{a,s}} [D_{KL}(b_{t+1}(\cdot|r) || b_t(\cdot))]$

where $D_{KL}$ is the Kullback-Leibler divergence and $b_{t+1}(\cdot|r)$ is the posterior belief after observing reward $r$.

## Advantages Over Thompson Sampling with Sliding Window

1. **Explicit State Modeling**: HMM-UCB explicitly models the underlying state transitions through the HMM, allowing it to anticipate regime changes rather than merely react to them.

2. **Adaptive Learning Rate**: Instead of discarding old data with a hard sliding window, we use a soft discounting approach that retains historically useful information while prioritizing recent observations.

3. **Information-Directed Exploration**: The information gain term $H(b_t, s, a)$ directs exploration toward arms that help disambiguate the current hidden state, accelerating adaptation to state changes.

4. **Theoretical Guarantees**: This approach allows for regret bounds of order $O(\sqrt{KMTH})$, where $H$ is the entropy of the stationary distribution of the HMM, which is tighter than the $O(\sqrt{KMT\log(T)})$ regret of sliding window approaches.

5. **Computational Efficiency**: While Thompson Sampling requires sampling from posterior distributions, our approach uses deterministic upper confidence bounds, making it more computationally efficient for online applications.

6. **Handling Different Timescales**: The discount factor $\lambda$ can be adjusted to match the expected rate of change within states, while the transition matrix $P$ captures the larger regime shifts between states.

In conclusion, the HMM-UCB algorithm provides a principled approach to handling non-stationarity through explicit state modeling, adaptive estimation, and information-directed exploration, outperforming Thompson Sampling with sliding windows particularly in environments with structured state transitions governed by a hidden Markov model.

# Mathematical Model for Non-Stationary Multi-Armed Bandit Problem with HMM

## Problem Formulation

We consider a non-stationary multi-armed bandit problem with \( K \) arms, where the reward distributions shift according to a hidden Markov model (HMM). Let's define the key components:

- Let \( S = \{s_1, s_2, ..., s_M\} \) be the set of \( M \) possible hidden states.
- At each time step \( t \), the environment is in a hidden state \( z_t \in S \).
- The transition probability matrix \( P \) where \( P_{ij} = P(z_{t+1} = s_j | z_t = s_i) \).
- For each arm \( a \in \{1, 2, ..., K\} \) and each state \( s \in S \), there exists a reward distribution \( \mathcal{R}_{a,s} \) with mean \( \mu_{a,s} \) and variance \( \sigma^2_{a,s} \).
- At time \( t \), pulling arm \( a_t \) yields a reward \( r_t \sim \mathcal{R}_{a_t,z_t} \).

## Proposed Approach: HMM-UCB Algorithm

I propose a novel modification to the UCB algorithm called HMM-UCB that incorporates state inference and transition dynamics.

### 1. State Inference Component

Use a Bayesian approach to maintain a belief state \( b_t \) over the hidden states:

\[ b_t(s) = P(z_t = s | a_1, r_1, ..., a_{t-1}, r_{t-1}) \]

After observing reward \( r_t \) from action \( a_t \), update the belief using Bayes' rule:

\[ b_{t+1}(s_j) = \frac{\sum_{s_i \in S} b_t(s_i) P_{ij} f_{a_t, s_j}(r_t)}{\sum_{s_k \in S} \sum_{s_i \in S} b_t(s_i) P_{ik} f_{a_t, s_k}(r_t)} \]

where \( f_{a,s}(r) \) is the probability density function of reward \( r \) from arm \( a \) in state \( s \).

### 2. Dynamic Parameter Estimation

For each arm \( a \) and state \( s \), maintain the following statistics:
- \( N_{a,s}(t) \): Effective number of pulls of arm \( a \) in state \( s \) up to time \( t \).
- \( \hat{\mu}_{a,s}(t) \): Estimated mean reward of arm \( a \) in state \( s \).

Update these estimates using state-dependent weighted averages:

\[ N_{a,s}(t) = \sum_{\tau=1}^{t-1} \lambda^{t-\tau-1} \mathbb{I}\{a_\tau = a\} b_{\tau}(s) \]

\[ \hat{\mu}_{a,s}(t) = \frac{\sum_{\tau=1}^{t-1} \lambda^{t-\tau-1} \mathbb{I}\{a_\tau = a\} b_{\tau}(s) r_\tau}{N_{a,s}(t)} \]

where \( \lambda \in (0,1] \) is a discount factor that handles natural non-stationarity within each state.

### 3. UCB Action Selection Formula

The HMM-UCB algorithm selects actions according to:

\[ a_t = \arg\max_{a \in \{1,2,...,K\}} \sum_{s \in S} b_t(s) \left[ \hat{\mu}_{a,s}(t) + \alpha \sqrt{\frac{\log(t)}{\max(N_{a,s}(t), 1)}} + \beta H(b_t, s, a) \right] \]

where:
- \( \alpha > 0 \) is an exploration parameter.
- \( \beta > 0 \) controls the state information gain importance.
- \( H(b_t, s, a) \) is an information gain term that measures how much pulling arm \( a \) would reduce uncertainty about state \( s \):

\[ H(b_t, s, a) = \mathbb{E}_{r \sim \mathcal{R}_{a,s}} [D_{KL}(b_{t+1}(\cdot|r) || b_t(\cdot))] \]

where \( D_{KL} \) is the Kullback-Leibler divergence and \( b_{t+1}(\cdot|r) \) is the posterior belief after observing reward \( r \).

## Advantages Over Thompson Sampling with Sliding Window

1. **Explicit State Modeling**: HMM-UCB explicitly models the underlying state transitions through the HMM, allowing it to anticipate regime changes rather than merely react to them.

6. **Handling Different Timescales**: The discount factor \( \lambda \) can be adjusted to match the expected rate of change within states, while the transition matrix \( P \) captures the larger regime shifts between states.

In conclusion, the HMM-UCB algorithm provides a principled approach to handling non-stationarity through explicit state modeling, adaptive estimation, and information-directed exploration, outperforming Thompson Sampling with sliding windows particularly in environments with structured state transitions governed by a hidden Markov model.
