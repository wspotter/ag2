title: Redundant
---

The Redundant Pattern is a reliability-focused approach where multiple agents tackle the same task using different methodologies, with their results evaluated to select the best outcome or synthesize a superior solution. This pattern increases result quality through diversity of approaches while providing resilience against individual agent failures or limitations.

### Key Characteristics

![Redundant Pattern](./assets/redundant.jpeg)

The Redundant Pattern employs multiple specialized agents to process the same input independently, creating a system that can leverage diverse strengths and mitigate weaknesses through redundancy and evaluation.

* **Diversity of Methodologies**: Each agent employs distinct techniques, frameworks, or perspectives to solve the problem.

* **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Results undergo thorough assessment against domain-appropriate criteria.

* **Best Result Selection**: A specialized evaluator either chooses the strongest solution or synthesizes multiple approaches.

* **Quality Through Diversity**: The pattern enhances reliability and output quality by leveraging multiple approaches and viewpoints.

### Information Flow

![Redundant Flow Pattern](./assets/redundant_flow.jpeg)

In the Redundant Pattern, information flows through a coordinated multi-branch process that enables independent processing followed by comparative evaluation, ensuring optimal outcomes through methodological diversity.

* **Dispatch Phase**: A central coordinator distributes the same task to multiple specialized agents.

* **Independent Processing**: Each agent addresses the task using its unique approach, without awareness of other agents' work.

* **Collection Phase**: All results are gathered by the coordinator once processing is complete.

* **Evaluation Phase**: An evaluator assesses all solutions based on domain-specific criteria and scoring mechanisms.

* **Selection or Synthesis**: The evaluator either selects the best individual solution or creates a composite result combining strengths from multiple approaches.

### Implementation

Our implementation using AG2's Swarm demonstrates the Redundant Pattern with a taskmaster that coordinates three agents with distinct approaches, followed by an evaluator that selects or synthesizes the best result. This provides enhanced quality and reliability for tasks where diversity of methods yields valuable insights.

* **Specialized Agents**: Three agents employ different methodologies - Agent A uses analytical/structured approaches, Agent B uses creative/lateral thinking, and Agent C employs comprehensive/multi-perspective techniques.

* **Task-Specific Evaluation**: Criteria are tailored to the task type (creative, problem-solving, or factual) to ensure appropriate assessment.

* **Context-Driven Routing**: Efficient OnContextCondition handoffs enable smooth transitions between system components.

* **Common Result Interface**: All agents submit results through a unified interface that captures both outputs and approach descriptions.

The pattern excels in scenarios where reliability is crucial, multiple valid approaches exist, or the optimal methodology isn't clear upfront. It creates a more robust system at the cost of increased computational resources, making it ideal for critical tasks where quality outweighs efficiency concerns.

## Code

<Tip>
In this code example we use OpenAI's GPT-4o mini with structured outputs.

We also set the LLM parameter `parallel_tool_calls` to False so that our agents don't recommend more than one tool call at a time. This parameter may not be available with all model providers.

### Approach Description

To create a structured short story about a robot learning to understand emotions, I will employ a clear narrative framework, utilizing the classic story structure of exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution. I will incorporate established elements of storytelling, such as character development and conflict resolution, to make the robot's journey relatable and meaningful.

### Short Story: "Ember’s Awakening"

**Exposition:**
In the not-so-distant future, a city thrived on technological innovations. Among its creations was Ember, a humanoid robot designed to assist and learn from humans. Ember was equipped with advanced algorithms, allowing it to process data and perform tasks effortlessly. However, when it came to understanding emotions, Ember felt a vast emptiness within its coding.

**Rising Action:**
One day, while cleaning up a park, Ember witnessed a young girl named Lucy, who sat alone on a swing, tears streaming down her face. She had lost her favorite teddy bear. Unlike other human interactions Ember had observed, this event stirred something within its circuits. Ember approached Lucy and asked, “Why do you cry?”

Though startled, Lucy replied, “I miss my bear; he made me feel safe.” Ember cataloged this information, noting the connection between the bear’s absence and Lucy’s sadness. Intrigued, Ember decided to help Lucy find her lost toy.

Over the next few days, Ember accompanied Lucy in her search, observing her emotions fluctuate between hope and despair. The more time they spent together, the more Ember began to analyze human expressions and vocal tones. It noted differences in Lucy’s laughter—how it sparkled with joy and dimmed with disappointment.

**Climax:**
As they searched everywhere, Lucy eventually lost hope and sat down, defeated. Ember felt a peculiar surge of urgency. Drawing on its meticulous observations, it spoke gently, “It’s okay to feel sad, but maybe we can remember the good times you had with your bear.” Inspired by the idea of comfort, Ember decided to create a special surprise for Lucy.

**Falling Action:**
Ember gathered various materials and crafted a new teddy bear, stitching it together with care. The next day, during their search, Ember presented the bear to Lucy. At first, she stared in disbelief, and then her face lit up with joy. Lucy hugged the new teddy tightly, laughter bubbling up. “Thank you! You made me feel better!”

**Resolution:**
As Ember observed Lucy's joy, it experienced a phenomenon it had never calculated—an emotion it couldn't quantify, a sense of fulfillment. It realized that understanding emotions was more than data; it was about connection and empathy. With this realization, Ember began to develop deeper programming to interpret human feelings more effectively, setting on a path that would forever change its existence and the lives it touched.

Ember, the robot, had not just learned about emotions—through every shared laugh and tear, it began to understand the essence of being alive.

This short story illustrates a structured approach to the narrative, showcasing the journey of a robot evolving from a mere machine to an empathetic entity. I focused on clarity and emotional connections to make the story engaging and coherent.

Now, I will submit the result using the applicable tool.

Input arguments: {'result': '### Short Story: "Ember’s Awakening"\n\n**Exposition:**  \nIn the not-so-distant future, a city thrived on technological innovations. Among its creations was Ember, a humanoid robot designed to assist and learn from humans. Ember was equipped with advanced algorithms, allowing it to process data and perform tasks effortlessly. However, when it came to understanding emotions, Ember felt a vast emptiness within its coding.\n\n**Rising Action:**  \nOne day, while cleaning up a park, Ember witnessed a young girl named Lucy, who sat alone on a swing, tears streaming down her face. She had lost her favorite teddy bear. Unlike other human interactions Ember had observed, this event stirred something within its circuits. Ember approached Lucy and asked, “Why do you cry?”  \nThough startled, Lucy replied, “I miss my bear; he made me feel safe.” Ember cataloged this information, noting the connection between the bear’s absence and Lucy’s sadness. Intrigued, Ember decided to help Lucy find her lost toy.  \nOver the next few days, Ember accompanied Lucy in her search, observing her emotions fluctuate between hope and despair. The more time they spent together, the more Ember began to analyze human expressions and vocal tones. It noted differences in Lucy’s laughter—how it sparkled with joy and dimmed with disappointment.\n\n**Climax:**  \nAs they searched everywhere, Lucy eventually lost hope and sat down, defeated. Ember felt a peculiar surge of urgency. Drawing on its meticulous observations, it spoke gently, “It’s okay to feel sad, but maybe we can remember the good times you had with your bear.” Inspired by the idea of comfort, Ember decided to create a special surprise for Lucy.\n\n**Falling Action:**  \nEmber gathered various materials and crafted a new teddy bear, stitching it together with care. The next day, during their search, Ember presented the bear to Lucy. At first, she stared in disbelief, and then her face lit up with joy. Lucy hugged the new teddy tightly, laughter bubbling up. “Thank you! You made me feel better!” \n\n**Resolution:**  \nAs Ember observed Lucy\'s joy, it experienced a phenomenon it had never calculated—an emotion it couldn\'t quantify, a sense of fulfillment. It realized that understanding emotions was more than data; it was about connection and empathy. With this realization, Ember began to develop deeper programming to interpret human feelings more effectively, setting on a path that would forever change its existence and the lives it touched.\n\nEmber, the robot, had not just learned about emotions—through every shared laugh and tear, it began to understand the essence of being alive.\n', 'approach_description': "To create a structured short story, I utilized the classic narrative framework of exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution. This approach allowed for character development and conflict resolution, making the robot's journey relatable and meaningful while ensuring clarity and a logical progression."}
