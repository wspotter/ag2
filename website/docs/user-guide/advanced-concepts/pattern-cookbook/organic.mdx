title: Organic
---

The simplest of the Swarm patterns, the Organic pattern utilizes entirely LLM-based transitions using the underlying Swarm Manager. The Swarm Manager uses the messages together with a set of the swarm's agent's [`description`](/docs/api-reference/autogen/ConversableAgent#description) fields to determine the next agent.

No hand-offs are specified as determining the next agent is solely done by the Swarm Manager. The shared context variables can still be used and updated via the agent's tools, though they don't play a role in determining the workflow.

This pattern excels in situations where conversation flow is unpredictable or where defining explicit rules would be overly complex. The organic approach creates a fluid user experience as different specialists naturally join the conversation when their expertise becomes relevant.

### Key Characteristics

![Organic Pattern](./assets/organic.jpeg)

The Organic Pattern creates a natural flow of agent interactions without explicit routing rules, allowing the system to adapt dynamically to conversation needs.

* **Natural Flow**: Transitions between agents happen organically based on the conversation context and content rather than predetermined paths.

* **Description-Based Routing**: The Swarm Manager selects the next agent based on agent descriptions and how well they match the current conversation needs.

* **Minimal Configuration**: No explicit handoff rules need to be defined, making this the simplest pattern to implement while maintaining sophisticated routing capabilities.

### Information Flow

![Organic Flow Pattern](./assets/organic_flow.jpeg)

In the Organic Pattern, information flows through the system based on content analysis and agent relevance, creating a fluid conversation experience that mimics natural human team collaboration.

* **Content Analysis**: The Swarm Manager analyzes each message to understand the context and requirements of the current conversation stage.

* **Agent Selection**: Based on this analysis, the system identifies and selects the most relevant specialist whose description best matches the current needs.

### Implementation

Our implementation using AG2's Swarm demonstrates the Organic Pattern with a team of specialized agents whose expertise areas are clearly defined in their descriptions, allowing the Swarm Manager to make intelligent routing decisions.

* **Descriptive Agent Profiles**: Each agent includes a detailed [`description`](/docs/api-reference/autogen/ConversableAgent#description) field that clearly outlines their domain expertise and when they should be activated. Note, the [`system_message`](/docs/api-reference/autogen/ConversableAgent#system-message) field will be used if an agent's [`description`](/docs/api-reference/autogen/ConversableAgent#description) field is not specified - however, it is better to define [`description`](/docs/api-reference/autogen/ConversableAgent#description) separately for use by the Swarm Manager, see the differences between [`description`](/docs/api-reference/autogen/ConversableAgent#description) and [`system_message`](/docs/api-reference/autogen/ConversableAgent#system-message) in the example below.

* **SWARM_MANAGER Configuration**: The implementation uses after_work=AfterWorkOption.SWARM_MANAGER to delegate all routing decisions to the Swarm Manager and we provide the Swarm Manager with an LLM through the `swarm_manager_args` parameter.

* **No Explicit Handoffs**: Unlike other patterns, no `register_hand_off` functions are required as the Swarm Manager handles all transitions automatically.

* **Shared Context**: While not used for routing decisions, shared context variables can still be used for maintaining state across different agents. In this example it's not used.
