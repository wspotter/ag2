title: Feedback Loop
---

The Feedback Loop Pattern creates a workflow where content progresses through repeated cycles of evaluation and improvement. Unlike linear approaches, this pattern enables continuous refinement through deliberate iterations that build upon previous work, with each cycle enhancing quality.

### Key Characteristics

![Feedback Loop Pattern](./assets/feedback_loop.jpeg)

* **Iterative Refinement**: Output from later stages feeds back to earlier stages for improvement

* **Quality Gates**: Review stages determine whether additional iterations are needed

* **Targeted Improvements**: Specific feedback guides revisions in subsequent cycles

* **Cumulative Enhancement**: Knowledge gained in each iteration informs future refinements

### Information Flow

![Feedback Loop Flow](./assets/feedback_loop_flow.jpeg)

In the Feedback Loop Pattern, information flows cyclically through specialized stages multiple times. The process begins with creation phases, followed by cycles of review and revision. These iterations continue until quality criteria are met, with context maintained throughout to ensure cohesive progression.

* **Creation → Review → Revision → Repeat**: Content cycles through these stages multiple times

* **Feedback-Driven Progress**: Each review generates actionable insights for improvement

* **State Preservation**: Context variables track document evolution across iterations

* **Quality-Based Termination**: Cycles continue until review determines no further iterations needed

### Implementation

Our implementation demonstrates the pattern through a document creation process with specialized agents handling distinct lifecycle stages. Through structured interfaces and state tracking, the system enables multiple improvement cycles while maintaining coherence and building upon previous work.

* **Specialized Agent Roles**: Six agents (Entry, Planning, Drafting, Review, Revision, Finalization) each focus on distinct tasks

* **Structured Data Exchange**: Pydantic models ensure consistent information transfer between stages

* **Context-Based Routing**: OnContextCondition handoffs direct content based on stage and iteration status

* **Reusable Expertise**: Review and Revision agents apply accumulated knowledge across multiple iterations

## Code

<Tip>
In this code example we use OpenAI's GPT-4o mini with structured outputs.

We also set the LLM parameter `parallel_tool_calls` to False so that our agents don't recommend more than one tool call at a time. This parameter may not be available with all model providers.

**Title: Investing in Our Future: The Case for Renewable Energy Solutions**

**Introduction**
In the face of escalating climate change, dwindling natural resources, and a pressing need for economic revitalization, the call for increased investment in renewable energy solutions has never been more urgent. Policymakers and business leaders play a pivotal role in shaping the future of our planet and our economy. By committing to renewable energy investments, we can unlock significant economic benefits, mitigate environmental damage, and stimulate innovative technologies that will pave the way for a sustainable future.

**The Economic Benefits of Renewable Energy**
Investing in renewable energy is not only an environmentally conscious choice; it is also an economically advantageous one. The renewable energy sector has shown remarkable resilience and growth potential, creating millions of jobs worldwide. According to a report from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the global renewable energy sector employed 11.5 million people in 2018, a number that has only continued to rise. By channeling investments into this sector, policymakers can drive job creation, stimulate local economies, and foster an environment conducive to innovation.

Moreover, renewable energy projects often yield long-term financial benefits. The cost of solar and wind energy has plummeted in recent years, making these solutions more competitive with fossil fuels. As businesses transition to renewable sources, they can enjoy lower energy costs in the long run, improving their bottom line while simultaneously reducing their carbon footprint. This economic advantage positions renewable energy as not just a solution for environmental sustainability but also a strategic business investment.

**Environmental Impact of Renewable Energy Solutions**
The consequences of climate change are increasingly visible, with severe weather events, rising sea levels, and widespread ecological disruption becoming the norm. The burning of fossil fuels is a leading contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, necessitating an urgent shift towards cleaner energy sources. By investing in renewable energy, we can significantly reduce carbon emissions and combat the adverse effects of climate change.

Renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power produce little to no emissions during operation. This transition is crucial for achieving the targets set by the Paris Agreement and for the preservation of our planet for future generations. Furthermore, renewable energy production often involves utilizing underused land, leading to minimal environmental disruption compared to traditional fossil fuel extraction and consumption. Investing in renewable energy is a vital step in protecting our ecosystems and ensuring a sustainable environment for all.

**Technological Innovations in Renewable Energy**
The renewable energy sector is at the forefront of technological innovation, driving advancements that enhance efficiency and reduce costs. Cutting-edge research and development in energy storage technologies, smart grid solutions, and energy efficiency measures are essential for maximizing the potential of renewable resources. As we invest in these technologies, we not only improve the efficacy of energy generation but also unlock new economic opportunities.

The emergence of electric vehicles (EVs) and their integration with renewable energy sources demonstrates the significant potential for technological innovation in this sector. Investments in EV infrastructure and renewable energy charging stations can create new markets and partnerships, propelling both economic growth and environmental sustainability. Furthermore, advancements in energy storage technologies—such as batteries that can store solar or wind energy—are crucial for addressing the intermittency challenges of renewable resources. These innovations contribute to a resilient energy system poised to meet demand more effectively.

**Call to Action for Investment**
To harness the full potential of renewable energy, policymakers and business leaders must take decisive action. Governments should implement supportive policies and incentives that encourage investment in renewable energy infrastructure. This includes offering tax credits, grants, and subsidies for businesses adopting renewable technologies, fostering a favorable environment for innovation and development.

Additionally, businesses are urged to prioritize sustainability in their operations. By investing in renewable energy projects, companies can enhance their reputations as responsible corporate citizens while reaping economic benefits. Collaboration between public and private sectors will be crucial in driving the transition towards a cleaner energy future.

**Conclusion**
Greater investment in renewable energy solutions is not merely an option; it is an imperative for our economic resilience, environmental health, and technological advancement. Policymakers and business leaders must recognize the profound benefits that arise from embracing renewable energy. By collaborating and investing in this sector, we can create job opportunities, combat climate change, and foster a more sustainable and prosperous future for generations to come. Let us commit to a bold vision of renewable energy investment—a vision that promises economic vitality and a healthier planet.

Now is the time to act. The future is renewable, and it is in our hands.

{"title":"Investing in Our Future: The Case for Renewable Energy Solutions","content":"**Title: Investing in Our Future: The Case for Renewable Energy Solutions**  \n\n**Introduction**  \nIn the face of escalating climate change, dwindling natural resources, and a pressing need for economic revitalization, the call for increased investment in renewable energy solutions has never been more urgent. Policymakers and business leaders play a pivotal role in shaping the future of our planet and our economy. By committing to renewable energy investments, we can unlock significant economic benefits, mitigate environmental damage, and stimulate innovative technologies that will pave the way for a sustainable future. This essay will delve into the economic benefits of renewable energy, the environmental impact of its implementation, and the technological innovations driving its growth, ultimately arguing that now is the critical moment for such investment.\n\n**The Economic Benefits of Renewable Energy**  \nInvesting in renewable energy is not only an environmentally conscious choice; it is also an economically advantageous one. The renewable energy sector has shown remarkable resilience and growth potential, creating millions of jobs worldwide. For instance, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) reported that the global renewable energy sector employed 11.5 million people in 2018, illustrating its potential to uplift economic conditions. Furthermore, in the United States, the solar and wind industries have been significant contributors to job creation, with estimates indicating that these sectors employed over 400,000 workers alone in 2020.  \n\nMoreover, renewable energy projects often yield long-term financial benefits. The cost of solar and wind energy has plummeted in recent years—solar energy costs, for example, have dropped by over 80% since 2010—making these solutions increasingly competitive with fossil fuels. As businesses transition to renewable sources, they can enjoy significantly lower energy costs in the long run, improving their bottom line while simultaneously reducing their carbon footprint. In addition to immediate cost savings, studies suggest that businesses can expect a return on investment (ROI) of up to 25% when investing in renewable projects. This economic advantage positions renewable energy as not just a solution for environmental sustainability but also a strategic business investment.\n\n**Environmental Impact of Renewable Energy Solutions** \nThe consequences of climate change are increasingly visible, with severe weather events, rising sea levels, and widespread ecological disruption becoming the norm. The burning of fossil fuels is a leading contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, necessitating an urgent shift towards cleaner energy sources. By investing in renewable energy, we can significantly reduce carbon emissions and combat the adverse effects of climate change.\n\nRenewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power produce little to no emissions during operation. This transition is crucial for achieving the targets set by the Paris Agreement and for the preservation of our planet for future generations. Furthermore, renewable energy production often involves utilizing underused land, leading to minimal environmental disruption compared to traditional fossil fuel extraction and consumption. However, while the benefits are substantial, it is important to acknowledge some challenges. For instance, the production of solar panels involves raw materials such as silicon, which can have environmental impacts if not sourced responsibly. To address these challenges, investments in recycling technologies and sustainable sourcing strategies must be prioritized. Investing in renewable energy is a vital step in protecting our ecosystems while also addressing these challenges thoughtfully.\n\n**Technological Innovations in Renewable Energy**  \nThe renewable energy sector is at the forefront of technological innovation, driving advancements that enhance efficiency and reduce costs. Cutting-edge research and development in energy storage technologies, smart grid solutions, and energy efficiency measures are essential for maximizing the potential of renewable resources. For example, Tesla's developments in battery technology have made energy storage more feasible and economically viable, allowing homes and businesses to use solar energy even when the sun isn’t shining. \n\nThe emergence of electric vehicles (EVs) and their integration with renewable energy sources demonstrates the significant potential for technological innovation in this sector. Investments in EV infrastructure and renewable energy charging stations can create new markets and partnerships, propelling both economic growth and environmental sustainability. Furthermore, technologies like grid-scale batteries, which can store solar or wind energy, are crucial for addressing the intermittency challenges of renewable resources. These innovations not only contribute to a resilient energy system but also facilitate scalability in clean energy adoption across different sectors, creating direct economic benefits through increased efficiency and lower costs.\n\n**Call to Action for Investment**  \nTo harness the full potential of renewable energy, policymakers and business leaders must take decisive action. Governments should implement supportive policies such as offering tax credits, grants, and subsidies for businesses adopting renewable technologies. Specific policy recommendations could include extending investment tax credits for solar projects or implementing feed-in tariffs for wind energy. Such measures foster a favorable environment for innovation and development while showcasing the economic opportunities at stake.  \n\nAdditionally, businesses are urged to prioritize sustainability in their operations. By investing in renewable energy projects, companies can enhance their reputations as responsible corporate citizens while reaping significant economic benefits. Successful public-private partnerships, such as those seen in the deployment of community solar projects, illustrate that collaboration can drive investments while serving diverse communities. Business leaders should recognize that an investment in renewables not only meets consumer demand for sustainability but is also a strategic move in a rapidly evolving market.\n\n**Conclusion**  \nGreater investment in renewable energy solutions is not merely an option; it is an imperative for our economic resilience, environmental health, and technological advancement. Policymakers and business leaders must recognize the profound benefits that arise from embracing renewable energy. By collaborating and investing in this sector, we can create job opportunities, combat climate change, and foster a more sustainable and prosperous future for generations to come.
