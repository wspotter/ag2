title: Installing AG2
---
<Tip>
We recommended using a virtual environment for your project to keep your packages contained. See [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).
</Tip>

Install AG2 on your machine:

```bash
pip install ag2
```

<Tip>
If you have been using `autogen` or `pyautogen`, all you need to do is upgrade it using:
```bash
pip install -U autogen
```
or
```bash
pip install -U pyautogen
```
as `pyautogen`, `autogen`, and `ag2` are aliases for the same PyPI package.
