title: LLMs
---

Your AG2 agents are likely to need an LLM and you can configure one, or more, for each agent.

AG2's agents can use LLMs through OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Amazon, Mistral AI, Cerebras, Together AI, and Groq. Locally hosted models can also be used through Ollama, LiteLLM, and LM Studio.

<Warning>
**From version 0.8**: The OpenAI package, `openai`, is not installed by default.

Install AG2 with your preferred model provider(s), for example:
- `pip install ag2[openai]`
- `pip install ag2[gemini]`
- `pip install ag2[anthropic,cohere,mistral]`
</Warning>

First, we define our configuration with the API type, model, and, if necessary, the key.

```python
import os

llm_config = {
  "config_list": [
    {
      "api_type": "openai",
      "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
      "api_key": os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]
    }
  ],
}
```

<Warning>
It is important to never hard-code secrets into your code, therefore we read the OpenAI API key from an environment variable.
</Warning>

Then, when you create your agents you'll set your LLM configuration:

```python
my_agent = ConversableAgent(
    name="helpful_agent",
    llm_config=llm_config,
    system_message="You are a poetic AI assistant",
)
```

The default LLM provider is OpenAI but if you would like to use a different provider, [see the available providers](/docs/user-guide/models/).

<Tip>
AG2's LLM configuration allows you to specify many LLMs for fallback support and the ability to filter them for an agent, see the [LLM Configuration deep-dive](/docs/user-guide/advanced-concepts/llm-configuration-deep-dive).
</Tip>

### Environment variables

The examples in these guides include an LLM configuration for OpenAI's `GPT-4o mini` model and will need the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable set with your OpenAI API key.

Set it in your terminal/command prompt:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="macOS / Linux">
    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    ```bash
    setx OPENAI_API_KEY "YOUR_API_KEY"
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
