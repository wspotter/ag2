title: Ending a chat
---

There are a number of ways a chat can end:
1. The maximum number of turns in a chat is reached
2. An agent's termination function passes on a received message
3. An agent automatically replies a maximum number of times
4. A human replies with 'exit' when prompted
5. In a group chat, there's no next agent
6. In a swarm, transitioning to AfterWorkOption.TERMINATE
7. Custom reply functions

### 1. Maximum turns
For GroupChat and swarm, use `max_round` to set a limit on the number of replies. Each round represents an agent speaking and includes the initial message.

```python
# GroupChat with a maximum of 5 rounds
groupchat = GroupChat(
    agents=[agent_a, agent_b, agent_c],
    speaker_selection_method="round_robin",
    max_round=5,
    ...
)
gcm = GroupChatManager(
    ...
)
agent_a.initiate_chat(gcm, "first message")
# 1. agent_a with "first message" > 2. agent_b > 3. agent_c > 4. agent_a > 5. agent_b > end

# Swarm with a maximum of 5 rounds
initiate_swarm_chat(
    agents=[agent_a, agent_b, agent_c],
    max_round=5,
    messages="first message"
    ...
)
# When initial agent is set to agent_a and agents hand off to the next agent.
# 1. User with "first message" > 2. agent_a > 3. agent_b > 4. agent_c > 5. agent_a > end
```

For `initiate_chat` use `max_turns`. Each turn represents a round trip of both agents speaking and includes the initial message.

```python
# initiate_chat with a maximum of 2 turns across the 2 agents (effectively 4 steps)
agent_a.initiate_chat(
    recipient=agent_b,
    max_turns=2,
    message="first message"
)
# 1. agent_a with "first message" > 1. agent_b > 2. agent_a > 2. agent_b > end
```

### 2. Terminating message
Agents can check their received message for a termination condition and, if that condition returns `True`, the chat will be ended. This check is carried out before they reply.

When constructing an agent, use the `is_termination_msg` parameter with a Callable. To save creating a function, you can use a [lambda function](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/controlflow.html#lambda-expressions) as in the example below.

It's important to put the termination check on the agents that will receive the message, not the agent creating the message.

```python
agent_a = ConversableAgent(
    system_message="You're a helpful AI assistant, end your responses with 'DONE!'"
    ...
)

# Terminates when the agent receives a message with "DONE!" in it.
agent_b = ConversableAgent(
    is_termination_msg=lambda x: "DONE!" in (x.get("content", "") or "").upper()
    ...
)

# agent_b > agent_a replies with message "... DONE!" > agent_b ends before replying
```

<Note>
If the termination condition is met and the agent's `human_input_mode` is "ALWAYS" or 'TERMINATE' (ConversableAgent's default), you will be asked for input and can decide to end the chat. If it is "NEVER" it will end immediately.
</Note>

### 3. Number of automatic replies

A conversation can be ended when an agent has responded to another agent a certain number of times. An agent evaluates this when it is next their time to reply, not immediately after they have replied.

When constructing an agent, use the `max_consecutive_auto_reply` parameter to set this.

```python
agent_a = ConversableAgent(
    max_consecutive_auto_reply=2
    ...
)

agent_b = ConversableAgent(
    ...
)

agent_a.initiate_chat(agent_b, ...)

# agent_a > agent_b > agent_a with first auto reply > agent_b > agent_a with second auto reply > agent_b > agent_a ends before replying
```

<Note>
If the agent's `human_input_mode` is "ALWAYS" or 'TERMINATE' (ConversableAgent's default), you will be asked for input and can decide to end the chat. If it is "NEVER" it will end immediately.
</Note>

### 4. Human replies with 'exit'
During the course of the conversation, if you are prompted and reply 'exit', the chat will end.

```console
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please give feedback to agent_a. Press enter to skip and use auto-reply, or type 'exit' to stop the conversation: exit
```

### 5. GroupChat, no next agent
If the next agent in a GroupChat can't be determined the chat will end.

If you are customizing the speaker selection method with a Callable, return `None` to end the chat.

### 6. Swarm, transitioning to end the chat
In a swarm, if you transition to `AfterWorkOption.TERMINATE` it will end the swarm. The default swarm-level AfterWork option is `AfterWorkOption.TERMINATE` and this will apply to any agent in the swarm that doesn't have an AfterWork hand-off specified.

Additionally, if you transition to `AfterWorkOption.REVERT_TO_USER` but have not specified a `user_agent` in `initiate_swarm_chat` then it will end the swarm.

### 7. Reply functions
AG2 provides the ability to create custom reply functions for an agent using `register_reply`.

In your function, return a `Tuple` of `True, None` to indicate that the reply is final with `None` indicating there's no reply and it should end the chat.

```python
agent_a = ConversableAgent(
    ...
)

agent_b = ConversableAgent(
    ...
)

def my_reply_func(
    recipient: ConversableAgent,
    messages: Optional[List[Dict]] = None,
    sender: Optional[Agent] = None,
    config: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> Tuple[bool, Union[str, Dict, None]]:
    return True, None # Indicates termination

# Register the reply function as the agent_a's first reply function
agent_a.register_reply(
    trigger=[Agent, None],
    reply_func=my_reply_func,
    position=0

)

agent_a.initiate_chat(agent_b, ...)

# agent_a > agent_b > agent_a ends with first custom reply function
```
