title: Slack Tools
---

If you want to add the ability for your agents to send and/or retrieve messages for your Slack channel [`SlackSendTool`](/docs/api-reference/autogen/tools/experimental/SlackSendTool) and [`SlackRetrieveTool`](/docs/api-reference/autogen/tools/experimental/SlackRetrieveTool) are easy to add.

<Tip>
If you haven't had a chance to read about how AG2's Communication Platform agents and tools work, read the [overview](/docs/user-guide/reference-agents/communication-platforms/overview) first.
</Tip>

## Installation

Install AG2 with the LLM model provider and Slack platform extra.

```bash
pip install ag2[openai,commsagent-slack]
```

### Capabilities

[`SlackSendTool`](/docs/api-reference/autogen/tools/experimental/SlackSendTool) can:
- Construct and send a message to the configured channel. If a message is longer than the platforms permitted message length, they will split the message into multiple messages.

[`SlackRetrieveTool`](/docs/api-reference/autogen/tools/experimental/SlackRetrieveTool) can:
- Retrieve the latest X messages from a channel.
- Retrieve messages since a given date.
- Retrieve messages since a given message ID.
- Retrieve a message given its ID.

<Tip>
Consider [`SlackAgent`](/docs/user-guide/reference-agents/communication-platforms/slackagent) if you don't want to build your agent with these tools, it is a ready-to-go AG2 agent that already incorporates the tools and messaging instructions.
</Tip>

### Platform configuration

Each tool is configured for a specific channel. This configuration is applied when you create the tool.

The tools require authentication (OAuth token) and channel details in order to send/retrieve messages.

Here are the steps to get a token:

- Create an app, from scratch, at https://api.slack.com/apps
- In your app settings, go to Features > OAuth & Permissions:
    - Under “Bot Token Scopes”, add these permissions:
      - chat:write (to send messages)
      - channels:history
      - channels:read (to access channel info)
      - groups:read (for private channels)
      - im:read (for direct messages)
      - users:read (to get user info)
      - files:read (to access file attachments)
      - groups:history
      - im:history
      - mpim:history
- With your app setup, now install it in your workspace, using the “Install App” menu, to create an OAuth Token.

To get the ID for your channel:

- Open Slack in a browser
- Navigate to your channel
- Get the channel ID from the URL (e.g., …/C12345678)

Finally you need to add the bot to your channel:

- In Slack, go to your channel
- Type `/invite @YourBotName`, e.g. `/invite @ag2commsagent`

Now you should be good to go with your OAuth token, channel ID, and a bot on your channel ready to send and retrieve messages!

### Code example

Here's a simple example using the Slack tools with a [`ConversableAgent`](/docs/api-reference/autogen/ConversableAgent)-based agent to send a weather forecast to a Slack channel.

```python
# Tools are available in the autogen.tools namespace
from autogen import ConversableAgent, register_function, LLMConfig
from autogen.tools.experimental import SlackRetrieveTool, SlackSendTool

# For running the code in Jupyter, use nest_asyncio to allow nested event loops
#import nest_asyncio
#nest_asyncio.apply()

# LLM configuration for our agent to select the tools and craft the message
# Put your key in the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
llm_config = LLMConfig(api_type="openai", model="gpt-4o-mini")

# Our tool executor agent, which will run the tools once recommended by the slack_agent, no LLM required
executor_agent = ConversableAgent(
    name="executor_agent",
    human_input_mode="NEVER",
)

# The main star of the show, our ConversableAgent-based agent
# We will attach the tools to this agent
with llm_config:
    slack_agent = ConversableAgent(
        name="slack_agent",
    )

# Create tools and register them with the agents

_bot_token = "xoxo..."  # CHANGE THIS, OAuth token
_channel_id = "C1234567"  # CHANGE THIS, ID of the Slack channel

# Create our Send tool
slack_send_tool = SlackSendTool(bot_token=_bot_token, channel_id=_channel_id)

# Register it for recommendation by our Slack agent
slack_send_tool.register_for_llm(slack_agent)

# Register it for execution by our executor agent
slack_send_tool.register_for_execution(executor_agent)

# And the same for our our Retrieve tool
slack_retrieve_tool = SlackRetrieveTool(bot_token=_bot_token, channel_id=_channel_id)
slack_retrieve_tool.register_for_llm(slack_agent)
slack_retrieve_tool.register_for_execution(executor_agent)

# Here we create a dummy weather function that will be used by our agent
def get_weather():
    return "The weather today is 25 degrees Celsius and sunny, with a late storm."

# Register it with the slack_agent for LLM tool recommendations
# and the executor_agent to execute it
register_function(
    get_weather,
    caller=slack_agent,
    executor=executor_agent,
    description="Get the current weather forecast",
)

# Start the conversation
# The slack_agent suggests the weather and send tools, crafting the Slack message
# while the executor_agent executes the weather tool and the Slack send tool
executor_agent.initiate_chat(
    recipient=slack_agent,
    message="Get the latest weather forecast and send it to our Slack channel. Use some emojis to make it fun!",
    max_turns=3,
)
```

Here's the message it sent:
![Slack output](/docs/user-guide/reference-agents/assets/commsplatforms_slack_sentmsg.png)

If you want to retrieve the last 5 messages to give a picture of the weather for the last week.

```python
executor_agent.initiate_chat(
    recipient=slack_agent,
    message="Get the last 5 messages about daily weather from our Slack channel and give me a summary of the week's weather.",
    max_turns=2,
)
```

# Tool execution

In AG2 the tool execution is typically handled by a separate agent that will follow the agent in the conversation (unless its in a swarm whereby tools are executed automatically). So, you will need to register the tools with another agent for execution.

You will see an example of this is the example code above.
