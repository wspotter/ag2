### Task 1: URL to Markdown file, query to summarize

Task Message:
```python
"Retrieve the document from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/FLAML/main/website/docs/Examples/Integrate%20-%20Spark.md and summarise it."
```

"### Summary of Completed Tasks
- **Documents Ingested**:
  - [Integration of FLAML with Spark](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/FLAML/main/website/docs/Examples/Integrate%20-%20Spark.md)

- **Documents Left to Ingest**: 0
- **Queries Left to Run**: 0

### Query and Answers

1. **Query**: Please summarize the document.
   **Answer**: The document discusses the integration of FLAML with Spark for distributed training, focusing on two main aspects: utilizing Spark ML estimators for AutoML and running training in parallel through Spark jobs.
   - **Spark ML Estimators**: It integrates estimators based on Spark ML models to enable parallel training. Data must be formatted correctly, and a utility function, `to_pandas_on_spark`, is provided for conversion.
   - **Data Formatting**: Data should be converted to a pandas-on-Spark dataframe or series, with feature columns merged into a single vector column using `VectorAssembler`.
   - **Estimators**: Models like `lgbm_spark` are available, and users must specify these in the `estimators_list` while using FLAML.
   - **Parallel Spark Jobs**: To activate Spark as the backend during parallel tuning, the `use_spark` argument should be set to true, except during AutoML for Spark Data since SparkML models inherently run in parallel.
   - The document also includes code examples for data preparation and FLAML configuration."

The document titled 'research-and-development-survey-2023-csv-notes.md' contains various notes and footnotes regarding the methodologies, categorizations, and definitions related to a survey on research and development (R&D) conducted in 2023. Key highlights include:

1. **Survey Scope**: The R&D Survey is conducted biennially and focuses on different sectors such as Business, Government, and Higher Education. However, in the years 2019, 2021, and 2023, the survey was only conducted in the business sector (Footnote 2).

2. **Data Handling**: Various footnotes provide information on how data is collected, including the rounding of figures for businesses and employees, and the exclusion of certain sectors or data types, such as licensing of intellectual property and subsidiaries (Footnotes 12, 29, and 30).

3. **Research Types**: There are several definitions related to types of research, including basic research, applied research, and experimental research, which clarify the intent and application of the research being performed (Footnotes 22-26).

4. **Results Handling**: Cautions are advised when interpreting results from specific categories due to small sample sizes, and results are treated with particular caution (Footnotes 3 and 28).

5. **Relative Sampling Errors**: The document mentions relative sampling errors, which quantify variability in results due to sampling, indicating the limitations of the data (Notes section).

6. **Symbols and Notations**: A section at the end outlines various symbols used throughout the data, such as indications for data not collected, confidential data, and figures that are provisional or revised (Symbols section).

Overall, the document serves as a technical note for understanding the R&D survey's data collection methods, definitions, and considerations for interpreting the results.

```

Files:
- [docagent_tests_story1.md](./assets/docagent_tests_story1.md)

| Ingested | InMemoryQueryEngine Query | Chroma Query Engine |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

Sample output:
```console
Ingestions:
1: /my_folder/docagent_tests_story1.md
2: /my_folder/docagent_tests_story2.md

Queries:
1: compare the stories in docagent_tests_story1.md and docagent_tests_story2.md
Answer: The stories in the documents 'docagent_tests_story1.md' and 'docagent_tests_story2.md' explore themes of memory, loss, and the human condition, but they do so in markedly different contexts and styles.

In docagent_tests_story2.md, the narrative is reflective and philosophical, centered around the essence of Christmas and the interplay of present joys with past aspirations. It discusses the nostalgia of unfulfilled dreams and lost loved ones, particularly during the festive season. The narrator recounts idealized memories of Christmas, contemplating how those who have passed should be remembered and welcomed into the celebration. The text emphasizes forgiveness, the importance of embracing both past and present experiences, and a deep sense of connection with loved ones, both living and deceased. The overall tone is warm, inviting, and imbued with a sense of hope and gratitude.

In contrast, docagent_tests_story1.md presents a more somber and introspective story about Mr. Woodifield and the boss, who reflects on the loss of his son killed in the war. The dialogue between the two characters highlights the loneliness and sorrow that accompany aging and grief. Mr. Woodifield, confined by his circumstances, cherishes his brief time spent away from home, where he shares news about the graves of their sons in Belgium. The boss is deeply affected by the mention of his son’s grave, leading him into a spiral of grief and reflection on his past. The story captures moments of mundane life interrupted by flashes of profound sorrow, focusing on a more immediate portrayal of loss.

In summary, while docagent_tests_story2.md deals broadly with nostalgia and memory during Christmas, encompassing both joys and sorrows in a festive spirit, docagent_tests_story1.md is more tightly focused on personal grief and the impact of loss on daily life, revealing the emotional weight carried by the characters. Both narratives address the interplay between the past and the present but do so through different lenses—one celebratory and inclusive, the other introspective and mournful.

### Test Code

Here is a basic Python code in line with the tests above. You will need to have `OPENAI_API_KEY` set in your environment variables.

```python
from autogen import ConversableAgent, LLMConfig
from autogen.agents.experimental import DocAgent, InMemoryQueryEngine
import json

llm_config = LLMConfig(api_type="openai", model="gpt-4o-mini", cache_seed=None)

llm_config_list = {"config_list": [llm_config]}
# InMemory Query Engine
inmemory_qe = InMemoryQueryEngine(llm_config=llm_config_list)

with llm_config:
  asking_agent = ConversableAgent(name="asking_agent", human_input_mode="ALWAYS")

  doc_agent = DocAgent(
      name="doc_agent",
      query_engine=inmemory_qe, # Comment this out if you want to use the default chroma vector store
      # collection_name="my_collection_name", # If using chroma, set unique collection names per run/question
  )
