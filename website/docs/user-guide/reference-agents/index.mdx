Our reference agents are fully-functional agents while being a great platform for you to explore and build upon to make your own AG2 agents.

Introducing you to...

## Communication Agents - DiscordAgent, SlackAgent, TelegramAgent

Get your message out through our communication agents. Designed to be a part of a larger workflow, they can send messages to their respective platforms with in-built messaging format guidelines to maximise impact.

In addition to sending, the agents can retrieve messages so your workflow can take action from posts.

Covering Discord, Slack, and Telegram. If you need to support another platform, use these agents as a starting point to create your own.
