[Ollama](https://ollama.com/) is a local inference engine that enables you to run open-weight LLMs in your environment. It has native support for a large number of models such as Google's Gemma, Meta's Llama 2/3/3.1, Microsoft's Phi 3, Mistral.AI's Mistral/Mixtral, and Cohere's Command R models.

Note: Previously, to use Ollama with AG2 you required LiteLLM. Now it can be used directly and supports tool calling.

## Features

When using this Ollama client class, messages are tailored to accommodate the specific requirements of Ollama's API and this includes message role sequences, support for function/tool calling, and token usage.

## Installing Ollama

For Mac and Windows, [download Ollama](https://ollama.com/download).

For Linux:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
```

## Downloading models for Ollama

Ollama has a library of models to choose from, see them [here](https://ollama.com/library).

Before you can use a model, you need to download it (using the name of the model from the library):

```bash
ollama pull llama3.1
```

To view the models you have downloaded and can use:

```bash
ollama list
```

## Getting started with AG2 and Ollama

When installing AG2, you need to install the AG2 package with the Ollama extra.

``` bash
pip install ag2[ollama]
```

<Tip>
If you have been using `autogen` or `pyautogen`, all you need to do is upgrade it using:
```bash
pip install -U autogen[ollama]
```
or
```bash
pip install -U pyautogen[ollama]
```
as `pyautogen`, `autogen`, and `ag2` are aliases for the same PyPI package.
</Tip>

See the sample `OAI_CONFIG_LIST` below showing how the Ollama client class is used by specifying the `api_type` as `ollama`.

```python
[
    {
        "model": "llama3.1",
        "api_type": "ollama"
    },
    {
        "model": "llama3.1:8b-instruct-q6_K",
        "api_type": "ollama"
    },
    {
        "model": "mistral-nemo",
        "api_type": "ollama"
    }
]
```

If you need to specify the URL for your Ollama install, use the `client_host` key in your config as per the below example:

```python
[
    {
        "model": "llama3.1",
        "api_type": "ollama",
        "client_host": "http://192.168.0.1:11434"
    }
]
```

## API parameters

The following Ollama parameters can be added to your config. See [this link](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/api.md#parameters) for further information on them.

- num_predict (integer): -1 is infinite, -2 is fill context, 128 is default
- num_ctx (integer)
- repeat_penalty (float)
- seed (integer)
- stream (boolean)
- temperature (float)
- top_k (int)
- top_p (float)

Example:
```python
[
    {
        "model": "llama3.1:instruct",
        "api_type": "ollama",
        "num_predict": -1,
        "num_ctx": 2048,
        "repeat_penalty": 1.1,
        "seed": 42,
        "stream": False,
        "temperature": 1,
        "top_k": 50,
        "top_p": 0.8
    }
]
```

## Two-Agent Coding Example

In this example, we run a two-agent chat with an AssistantAgent (primarily a coding agent) to generate code to count the number of prime numbers between 1 and 10,000 and then it will be executed.

We'll use Meta's Llama 3.1 model which is suitable for coding.

In this example we will specify the URL for the Ollama installation using `client_host`.

```python
config_list = [
    {
        # Let's choose the Meta's Llama 3.1 model (model names must match Ollama exactly)
        "model": "llama3.1:8b",
        # We specify the API Type as 'ollama' so it uses the Ollama client class
        "api_type": "ollama",
        "stream": False,
        "client_host": "http://192.168.0.1:11434",
    }
]

# Importantly, we have tweaked the system message so that the model doesn't return the termination keyword, which we've changed to FINISH, with the code block.

from pathlib import Path

from autogen import AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent, LLMConfig
from autogen.coding import LocalCommandLineCodeExecutor

# Setting up the code executor
workdir = Path("coding")
workdir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
code_executor = LocalCommandLineCodeExecutor(work_dir=workdir)

# Setting up the agents

# The UserProxyAgent will execute the code that the AssistantAgent provides
user_proxy_agent = UserProxyAgent(
    name="User",
    code_execution_config={"executor": code_executor},
    is_termination_msg=lambda msg: "FINISH" in msg.get("content"),
)

system_message = """You are a helpful AI assistant who writes code and the user
executes it. Solve tasks using your python coding skills.
In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) for the

# The AssistantAgent, using the Ollama config, will take the coding request and return code
assistant_agent = AssistantAgent(
    name="Ollama Assistant",
    system_message=system_message,
    llm_config=LLMConfig(config_list=config_list),
)

# Start the chat, with the UserProxyAgent asking the AssistantAgent the message
chat_result = user_proxy_agent.initiate_chat(
    assistant_agent,
    message="Provide code to count the number of prime numbers from 1 to 10000.",
)
```

## Tool Calling - Native vs Manual

Ollama supports native tool calling (Ollama v0.3.1 library onward). If you install AG2 with `pip install ag2[ollama]` you will be able to use native tool calling.

The parameter `native_tool_calls` in your configuration allows you to specify if you want to use Ollama's native tool calling (default) or manual tool calling.

```python
[
    {
        "model": "llama3.1",
        "api_type": "ollama",
        "client_host": "http://192.168.0.1:11434",
        "native_tool_calls": True # Use Ollama's native tool calling, False for manual
    }
]
```

Native tool calling only works with certain models and an exception will be thrown if you try to use it with an unsupported model.

Manual tool calling allows you to use tool calling with any Ollama model. It incorporates guided tool calling messages into the prompt that guide the LLM through the process of selecting a tool and then evaluating the result of the tool. As to be expected, the ability to follow instructions and return formatted JSON is highly dependent on the model.

You can tailor the manual tool calling messages by adding these parameters to your configuration:

- `manual_tool_call_instruction`
- `manual_tool_call_step1`
- `manual_tool_call_step2`

To use manual tool calling set `native_tool_calls` to `False`.

## Reducing repetitive tool calls

By incorporating tools into a conversation, LLMs can often continually recommend them to be called, even after they've been called and a result returned. This can lead to a never-ending cycle of tool calls.

To remove the chance of an LLM recommending a tool call, an additional parameter called `hide_tools` can be used to specify when tools are hidden from the LLM. The string values for the parameter are:

- 'never': tools are never hidden
- 'if_all_run': tools are hidden if all tools have been called
- 'if_any_run': tools are hidden if any tool has been called

This can be used with native or manual tool calling, an example of a configuration is shown below.

```python
[
    {
        "model": "llama3.1",
        "api_type": "ollama",
        "client_host": "http://192.168.0.1:11434",
        "native_tool_calls": True,
        "hide_tools": "if_any_run" # Hide tools once any tool has been called
    }
]
```

## Tool Call Example

In this example, instead of writing code, we will have an agent assist with some trip planning using multiple tool calling.

Again, we'll use Meta's versatile Llama 3.1.

Native Ollama tool calling will be used and we'll utilise the `hide_tools` parameter to hide the tools once all have been called.

```python
import json
from typing import Literal

from typing_extensions import Annotated

import autogen

config_list = [
    {
        # Let's choose the Meta's Llama 3.1 model (model names must match Ollama exactly)
        "model": "llama3.1:8b",
        "api_type": "ollama",
        "stream": False,
        "client_host": "http://192.168.0.1:11434",
        "hide_tools": "if_any_run",
    }
]

# We'll create our agents. Importantly, we're using native Ollama tool calling and to help guide it we add the JSON to the system_message so that the number fields aren't wrapped in quotes (becoming strings).

# Create the agent for tool calling

    name="chatbot",
    system_message="""For currency exchange and weather forecasting tasks,

Based on the results, it seems that:

* The weather forecast for New York is expected to be around 11 degrees Fahrenheit.
* The exchange rate for EUR to USD is currently 1 EUR = 1.3580 USD, so 123.45 EUR is equivalent to approximately 135.80 USD.

As a bonus, here are some holiday tips in New York:

* Be sure to try a classic New York-style hot dog from a street cart or a diner.
* Explore the iconic Central Park and take a stroll through the High Line for some great views of the city.
* Catch a Broadway show or a concert at one of the many world-class venues in the city.

And... HAVE FUN!
