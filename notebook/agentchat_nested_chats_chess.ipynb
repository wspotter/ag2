    "# Nested Chats for Tool Use in Conversational Chess\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to create agents that can play chess with each other\n",
    "while communicating in natural language.\n",
    "The key concept covered in this notebook is the use of nested chats\n",
    "to enable tool use and packaging an LLM-based agent with a tool executor agent\n",
    "into a single agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Related tutorials:\n",
    "- [Tool Use](https://docs.ag2.ai/docs/user-guide/basic-concepts/tools/basics)\n",
    "- [Nested Chats](https://docs.ag2.ai/docs/user-guide/basic-concepts/orchestration/nested-chat)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this setting, each player is an agent backed by an LLM equipped two tools:\n",
    "- `get_legal_moves` to get a list of current legal moves.\n",
    "- `make_move` to make a move.\n",
    "\n",
    "A board proxy agent is set up to execute the tools and manage the game.\n",
    "It is important to use a board proxy as a non-LLM \"guard rail\" to ensure the game\n",
    "is played correctly and to prevent agents from making illegal moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time a player agent receives a message from the other player agent, \n",
    "it instantiates a nested chat with the board proxy agent to get the legal moves\n",
    "and make a move using the tools given. \n",
    "The nested chat between the player agent and the board agent\n",
    "continues until the a legal move is made by the tool.\n",
    "Once the nested chat concludes, the player agent sends a message to the\n",
    "other player agent about the move made."
