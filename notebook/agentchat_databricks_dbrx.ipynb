    "# Use AG2 in Databricks with DBRX\n",
    "\n",
    "![DBRX launch](https://www.databricks.com/en-blog-assets/static/2fe1a0af1ee0f6605024a810b604079c/dbrx-blog-header-optimized.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In March 2024, Databricks released [DBRX](https://www.databricks.com/blog/introducing-dbrx-new-state-art-open-llm), a general-purpose LLM that sets a new standard for open LLMs. While available as an open-source model on Hugging Face ([databricks/dbrx-instruct](https://huggingface.co/databricks/dbrx-instruct/tree/main) and [databricks/dbrx-base](https://huggingface.co/databricks/dbrx-base) ), customers of Databricks can also tap into the [Foundation Model APIs](https://docs.databricks.com/en/machine-learning/model-serving/score-foundation-models.html#query-a-chat-completion-model), which make DBRX available through an OpenAI-compatible, autoscaling REST API.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Autogen](https://docs.ag2.ai/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat) is becoming a popular standard for agent creation. Built to support any \"LLM as a service\" that implements the OpenAI SDK, it can easily be extended to integrate with powerful open source models. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will demonstrate a few basic examples of Autogen with DBRX, including the use of  `AssistantAgent`, `UserProxyAgent`, and `ConversableAgent`. These demos are not intended to be exhaustive - feel free to use them as a base to build upon!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "AG2 must be installed on your Databricks cluster, and requires `Python>=3.9`. This example includes the `%pip` magic command to install: `%pip install pyautogen`, as well as other necessary libraries. \n",
    "\n",
    "This code has been tested on: \n",
    "* [Serverless Notebooks](https://docs.databricks.com/en/compute/serverless/index.html) (in public preview as of Apr 18, 2024)\n",
    "* Databricks Runtime 14.3 LTS ML [docs](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/release-notes/runtime/14.3lts-ml)\n",
    "\n",
    "This code can run in any Databricks workspace in a region where DBRX is available via pay-per-token APIs (or provisioned throughput). To check if your region is supported, see [Foundation Model Region Availability](https://docs.databricks.com/en/machine-learning/model-serving/model-serving-limits.html#foundation-model-apis-limits). If the above is true, the workspace must also be enabled by an admin for Foundation Model APIs [docs](https://docs.databricks.com/en/machine-learning/foundation-model-apis/index.html#requirements).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips\n",
    "* This notebook can be imported from github to a Databricks workspace and run directly. Use [sparse checkout mode with git](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2023/01/26/work-large-monorepos-sparse-checkout-support-databricks-repos.html) to import only this notebook or the examples directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Databricks recommends using [Secrets](https://docs.databricks.com/en/security/secrets/secrets.html) instead of storing tokens in plain text. \n",
