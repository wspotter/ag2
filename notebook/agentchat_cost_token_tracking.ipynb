    "# Usage tracking with AutoGen\n",
    "## 1. Use AutoGen's OpenAIWrapper for cost estimation\n",
    "The `OpenAIWrapper` from `autogen` tracks token counts and costs of your API calls. Use the `create()` method to initiate requests and `print_usage_summary()` to retrieve a detailed usage report, including total cost and token usage for both cached and actual requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `mode=[\"actual\", \"total\"]` (default): print usage summary for non-caching completions and all completions (including cache).\n",
    "- `mode='actual'`: only print non-cached usage.\n",
    "- `mode='total'`: only print all usage (including cache).\n",
    "\n",
    "Reset your session's usage data with `clear_usage_summary()` when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Track cost and token count for agents\n",
    "We also support cost estimation for agents. Use `Agent.print_usage_summary()` to print the cost summary for the agent.\n",
    "You can retrieve usage summary in a dict using `Agent.get_actual_usage()` and `Agent.get_total_usage()`. Note that `Agent.reset()` will also reset the usage summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "To gather usage data for a list of agents, we provide an utility function `autogen.gather_usage_summary(agents)` where you pass in a list of agents and gather the usage summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Custom token price for up-to-date cost estimation\n",
    "AutoGen tries to keep the token prices up-to-date. However, you can pass in a `price` field in `config_list` if the token price is not listed or up-to-date. Please creating an issue or pull request to help us keep the token prices up-to-date!\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: in json files, the price should be a list of two floats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Usage:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"model\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo-xxxx\",\n",
    "    \"api_key\": \"YOUR_API_KEY\",\n",
    "    \"price\": [0.0005, 0.0015]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Caution when using Azure OpenAI!\n",
    "If you are using azure OpenAI, the model returned from completion doesn't have the version information. The returned model is either 'gpt-35-turbo' or 'gpt-4'. From there, we are calculating the cost based on gpt-3.5-turbo-0125: (0.0005, 0.0015) per 1k prompt and completion tokens and gpt-4-0613: (0.03, 0.06). This means the cost can be wrong if you are using a different version from azure OpenAI.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will be improved in the future. However, the token count summary is accurate. You can use the token count to calculate the cost yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
