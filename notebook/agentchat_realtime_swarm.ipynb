    "AG2 supports **RealtimeAgent**, a powerful agent type that connects seamlessly to OpenAI's [Realtime API](https://openai.com/index/introducing-the-realtime-api). With RealtimeAgent, you can add voice interaction and listening capabilities to your swarms, enabling dynamic and natural communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "AG2 provides an intuitive programming interface to build and orchestrate swarms of agents. With RealtimeAgent, you can enhance swarm functionality, integrating real-time interactions alongside task automation. Check the [Documentation](https://docs.ag2.ai/docs/user-guide/advanced-concepts/swarm/deep-dive) and [Blog](https://docs.ag2.ai/blog/2024-11-17-Swarm) for further insights.\n",
