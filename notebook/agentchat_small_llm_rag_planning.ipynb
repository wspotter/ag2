    "# Small, Local Model (IBM Granite) Multi-Agent RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you create effective agents with small, 8B-parameter models? Yes, you can.\n",
    "\n",
    "Small LLMs, like the IBM Granite 8B, are advantageous because they can run locally on a powerful laptop, eliminating the need for API calls to external service providers. But can you create effective agents with them? This answer is \"yes\" - with the right techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to optimize the performance of small language models, such as the IBM Granite 8B, in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow. By combining document and web search tools with a high-level planner and reflection-driven agents, it achieves effective, dynamic problem-solving. The notebook also shows how this process can be executed locally using Ollama, with examples provided later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Workflow Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Plan Creation (Planner):\n",
    "  - The Planner generates an initial plan based on user instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Plan Execution (Iterative Process):\n",
    "  - The plan is carried out step-by-step through multiple iterations:\n",
    "    - Step Selection: If no prior outputs exist, the first step of the plan is executed. Otherwise, the system evaluates the results of previous steps using the Generic Assistant before advancing.\n",
    "    - Information Retrieval: Each step is executed by the Research Assistant, which performs web and document searches to gather relevant data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Reflection and Adjustment (Reflection Assistant):\n",
    " - After each step, the Reflection Assistant evaluates its success and determines how to adapt the plan, if needed. This ensures the workflow remains flexible and responsive to intermediate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Final Output:\n",
    " - The accumulated contextual information is synthesized into a final response, directly addressing the user’s original query.\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging these tactics, this notebook showcases how smaller models, equipped with effective planning and reflection mechanisms, can deliver impactful results even on resource-constrained systems.\n"
