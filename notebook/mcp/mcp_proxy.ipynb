    "# MCP Proxy\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is an open protocol that defines a standardized way to provide context to large language models (LLMs). By using MCP, applications can seamlessly interact with LLMs in a structured and efficient manner, making it easier to exchange information, use external tools, and enhance the capabilities of language models in a consistent and reusable way.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide will walk you through how to create **MCP clients** that connect to MCP servers, enabling you to utilize external tools and processes efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to MCP\n",
    "\n",
    "MCP aims to standardize how applications provide contextual information to LLMs and how LLMs can access external tools. MCP servers expose specific tools that are accessible via different communication protocols, such as [`stdio` (Standard Input/Output)](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/basic/transports/#stdio) and [`SSE` (Server-Sent Events)](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/basic/transports/#http-with-sse).\n",
    "\n",
    "MCP clients are responsible for interacting with these servers, sending requests, and processing responses. By integrating MCP into your application, you can build systems where LLMs can utilize external computational tools in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide, we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Set up an MCP server that exposes basic mathematical tools (`add` and `multiply`).\n",
    "- Connect the AG2 framework to this MCP server.\n",
    "- Communicate using two different transport protocols: [stdio](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/basic/transports/#stdio) and [SSE](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/basic/transports/#http-with-sse).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "To integrate MCP tools into the AG2 framework, install the required dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -U ag2[openai,mcp,mcp-proxy-gen]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** If you have been using `autogen` or `pyautogen`, all you need to do is upgrade it using:  \n",
    "> ```bash\n",
    "> pip install -U autogen[openai,mcp,mcp-proxy-gen]\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "> or  \n",
    "> ```bash\n",
    "> pip install -U pyautogen[openai,mcp,mcp-proxy-gen]\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "> as `pyautogen`, `autogen`, and `ag2` are aliases for the same PyPI package.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Imports\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into the code, let’s go over the main imports used in this guide:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ClientSession`: Manages the client session for connecting to the MCP server, allowing you to send requests and handle responses.\n",
    "- `StdioServerParameters`: Provides parameters to set up communication with an MCP server over `stdio`.\n",
    "- `stdio_client`: A utility that helps you connect to an MCP server using the standard input/output protocol.\n",
    "- `sse_client`: A utility to connect to an MCP server using the `SSE` (Server-Sent Events) protocol.\n",
    "- `create_toolkit`: A helper function that creates a toolkit, wrapping the tools exposed by the MCP server for easier access.\n"
