    "# Solving Complex Tasks with Nested Chats\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how you can leverage **nested chats** to solve complex task with AG2. Nested chats is a sequence of chats created by a receiver agent after receiving a message from a sender agent and finished before the receiver agent replies to this message. Nested chats allow AG2 agents to use other agents as their inner monologue to accomplish tasks. This abstraction is powerful as it allows you to compose agents in rich ways. This notebook shows two basic examples of nested chat.\n",
