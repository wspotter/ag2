    "# Auto Generated Agent Chat: Collaborative Task Solving with Multiple Agents and Human Users\n",
    "\n",
    "AG2 offers conversable agents powered by LLM, tool, or human, which can be used to perform tasks collectively via automated chat. This framework allows tool use and human participation through multi-agent conversation. Please find documentation about this feature [here](https://docs.ag2.ai/latest/docs/user-guide/basic-concepts/conversable-agent/).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate an application involving multiple agents and human users to work together and accomplish a task. `AssistantAgent` is an LLM-based agent that can write Python code (in a Python coding block) for a user to execute for a given task. `UserProxyAgent` is an agent which serves as a proxy for a user to execute the code written by `AssistantAgent`. We create multiple `UserProxyAgent` instances that can represent different human users.\n",

    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "AG2 requires `Python>=3.9`. To run this notebook example, please install:\n",
