    "In this notebook we introduce send and retrieve message tools for 3 messaging platforms: Discord, Slack, and Telegram.\n",
    "\n",
    "These tools can be added to your AG2 agents, enabling them to send messages during a workflow and/or retrieve messages for use by the workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of tools, with one for each platform:\n",

    "- Sending a message (`DiscordSendTool`, `SlackSendTool`, `TelegramSendTool`)\n",
    "- Retrieving messages (`DiscordRetrieveTool`, `SlackRetrieveTool`, `TelegramRetrieveTool`)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can attach one or more of them to an agent, though it may be most typical that you create an agent for each platform and attach their respective send and/or retrieve tools. This would allow you to tailor your system message for your agent to the messaging style used for the platform."
