    "In this notebook, we introduce CaptainAgent, an agent enhanced with the capability to call AutoBuild to break down and solve complex tasks. AutoBuild can initiate a group chat between a group of experts and converse to solve the task. The experts in nested chat can be retrieved from agent library. The agents can be equipped with tools for advanced coding.\n",
