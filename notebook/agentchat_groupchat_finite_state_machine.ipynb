    "The current GroupChat class allows transitioning to any agent (with or without the decision of the LLM), some use cases might demand for more control over transition. A graph is a possible way to control the transition paths, where each node represents an agent and each directed edge represents possible transition paths. Let's illustrate the current transition paths for a GroupChat with five agents."
