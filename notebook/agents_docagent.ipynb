    "\n",
    "- **Triage Agent**: Decides what type of task to perform from user requests.\n",
    "- **Task Manager Agent**: Manages the tasks and initiates actions.\n",
    "- **Data Ingestion Agent**: Ingests the documents.\n",
    "- **Query Agent**: Answers user questions based on ingested documents.\n",
    "- **Error Agent**: If anything fails, the error agent will report the problem back.\n",
    "- **Summary Agent**: Generates a summary of the completed tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it is the DocAgent's turn to reply, the DocAgent initializes the agents and sets up the context variables, then:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Triage User Requests**: The `Triage Agent` categorizes the tasks into ingestions and queries.\n",
    "2. **Task Management**: The `Task Manager Agent` manages the tasks and ensures they are executed in the correct sequence.\n",
    "3. **Data Ingestion**: The `Data Ingestion Agent` processes any document ingesting tasks.\n",
    "4. **Query Execution**: The `Query Agent` answers any user queries.\n",
    "5. **Summary Generation**: The `Summary Agent` generates a summary of the completed tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The swarm is dynamic in that if only a data ingestation task is required, it will do that. Similarly for queries. This allows you to use the DocAgent many times covering the needs of ingesting, querying, or doing both at the same time."

    "- When asking for information from ingested information, be precise. For example, asking for revenue for the quarter in the previous example could retrieve a number of different revenue values, so we ask for \"GAAP revenue\" for the specific quarter.\n",
    "- If you have ingested documents in previous runs and just need to query the information, be clear to the DocAgent that they don't need to ingest documents you refer to.\n",
    "- Ensure that any files to be ingested can be accessed by the process you are running.\n",
    "- Ingestions take time, be sure to use `collection_name` to reuse collections that have already had the documents ingested in to.\n",
    "- You can review the Markdown files ingested in the `parsed_docs` folder to see how effective the conversion to Markdown was. This will help you investigate any query issues. "
