    "AG2 offers conversable agents, powered by LLMs, tools or a human, that can perform tasks collectively via an automated chat. Recently, OpenAI released a [Swarm](https://github.com/openai/swarm) framework that focuses on making agent coordination and execution lightweight. \n",
    "\n",
    "In AG2 we offer a simple programming interface to build and orchestrate a swarm of agents. Please check the [Documentation](https://docs.ag2.ai/docs/user-guide/advanced-concepts/swarm/deep-dive) and [Blog](https://docs.ag2.ai/latest/docs/blog/2024/11/17/Swarm) for more details.\n",

    "After learning the fundamentals of AG2's swarm in this notebook, check out [this notebook](https://docs.ag2.ai/docs/use-cases/notebooks/notebooks/agentchat_swarm) where we take on some more advanced techniques that provide greater control and predicability for your swarms.\n",
