    "# Auto Generated Agent Chat: Task Solving with Code Generation, Execution, Debugging & Human Feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "AG2 offers conversable agents powered by LLM, tool, or human, which can be used to perform tasks collectively via automated chat. This framework allows tool use and human participation through multi-agent conversation.\n",
    "Please find documentation about this feature [here](https://docs.ag2.ai/latest/docs/user-guide/basic-concepts/conversable-agent/).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate how to use `AssistantAgent` and `UserProxyAgent` to solve a challenging math problem with human feedback. Here `AssistantAgent` is an LLM-based agent that can write Python code (in a Python coding block) for a user to execute for a given task. `UserProxyAgent` is an agent which serves as a proxy for a user to execute the code written by `AssistantAgent`. By setting `human_input_mode` properly, the `UserProxyAgent` can also prompt the user for feedback to `AssistantAgent`. For example, when `human_input_mode` is set to \"ALWAYS\", the `UserProxyAgent` will always prompt the user for feedback. When user feedback is provided, the `UserProxyAgent` will directly pass the feedback to `AssistantAgent`. When no user feedback is provided, the `UserProxyAgent` will execute the code written by `AssistantAgent` and return the execution results (success or failure and corresponding outputs) to `AssistantAgent`.\n",
