    "In this tutorial, we demonstrate how to integrate LLM tools from [LangChain Tools](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/tools), [CrewAI Tools](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-tools/tree/main) into CaptainAgent. The developers just need to use one line of code to convert them into [AG2 tools](https://docs.ag2.ai/docs/use-cases/notebooks/notebooks/tools_interoperability), and then pass it to CaptainAgent while instantiation, simple as that."
