    "# Group Chat with Customized Speaker Selection Method\n",
    "\n",
    "AG2 offers conversable agents powered by LLM, tool or human, which can be used to perform tasks collectively via automated chat. This framework allows tool use and human participation through multi-agent conversation.\n",
    "Please find documentation about this feature [here](https://docs.ag2.ai/latest/docs/user-guide/basic-concepts/conversable-agent/).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate how to pass a customized agent selection method to GroupChat. The customized function looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def custom_speaker_selection_func(last_speaker, groupchat):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Define a customized speaker selection function.\n",
    "    A recommended way is to define a transition for each speaker in the groupchat.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Parameters:\n",
    "        - last_speaker: Agent\n",
    "            The last speaker in the group chat.\n",
    "        - groupchat: GroupChat\n",
    "            The GroupChat object\n",
    "    Return:\n",
    "        Return one of the following:\n",
    "        1. an `Agent` class, it must be one of the agents in the group chat.\n",
    "        2. a string from ['auto', 'manual', 'random', 'round_robin'] to select a default method to use.\n",
    "        3. None, which indicates the chat should be terminated.\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "groupchat = autogen.GroupChat(\n",
    "    speaker_selection_method=custom_speaker_selection_func,\n",
    "    ...,\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "The last speaker and the groupchat object are passed to the function. Commonly used variables from groupchat are `groupchat.messages` an `groupchat.agents`, which is the message history and the agents in the group chat respectively. You can access other attributes of the groupchat, such as `groupchat.allowed_speaker_transitions_dict` for pre-defined allowed_speaker_transitions_dict. \n",
