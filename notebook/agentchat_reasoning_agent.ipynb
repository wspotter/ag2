    "# ReasoningAgnet (Tree of Thoughts with Beam Search)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository demonstrates how to implement a Tree of Thoughts (ToT) reasoning agent using beam search in under 50 lines of core code (excluding auxiliary components like visualization and logging). The `ReasoningAgent` leverages large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 or Llama to perform complex reasoning tasks by exploring multiple thought trajectories.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the provided example, we showcase how the `ReasoningAgent`, even when using a smaller model (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`), can effectively generate and evaluate multiple reasoning paths to solve intricate problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is the Tree of Thoughts and Beam Search?\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Tree of Thoughts (ToT)** is a reasoning framework where an agent considers multiple possible reasoning steps (thoughts) and organizes them into a tree structure. **Beam search** is an optimization algorithm that explores a subset of the tree by keeping the top `k` options at each level (the beam size). Combining ToT with beam search allows the agent to efficiently navigate through the most promising thought trajectories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use **Beam Size = 1** for a special case of O1-style reasoning, which is similar to CoT with multiple prompts. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Enhanced Problem-Solving**: Implements the Tree of Thoughts framework to improve reasoning capabilities.\n",
    "- **Beam Search Optimization**: Utilizes beam search to efficiently explore and evaluate multiple thought paths.\n",
    "- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Includes a thinker agent to generate possible next steps and a grader agent to evaluate them.\n",

      "### The Rise of NVIDIA: Powering the Future of Technology\n",
      "\n",
      "In the fast-paced world of technology, few companies have managed to define and redefine their industry quite like NVIDIA. Established in 1993, NVIDIA initially made its mark by revolutionizing graphics processing units (GPUs), which transformed video gaming. However, the digital landscape has undergone significant changes, and so has NVIDIA, now standing at the forefront of innovations in artificial intelligence (AI), self-driving vehicles, and high-performance computing.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### The Graphics Giant\n",
      "\n",
      "NVIDIA's core strength lies in its GPUs. The launch of the GeForce series positioned the company as a staple in the gaming industry, delivering unmatched graphics and performance to both casual players and hardcore enthusiasts. As the gaming sector flourished into a multi-billion dollar industry, NVIDIA embraced this growth by introducing transformative technologies like ray tracing and deep learning super sampling (DLSS). These advancements not only amplify the visual experience but also optimize performance, allowing gamers to enjoy more realistic gameplay without sacrificing speed.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Pioneering AI and Machine Learning\n",
      "\n",
      "NVIDIA’s influence now extends far beyond gaming. By developing powerful platforms tailored for AI and machine learning, NVIDIA has become a leader in this domain. Its GPUs accelerate a plethora of AI applications, from advanced image recognition to sophisticated natural language processing. The NVIDIA CUDA programming model empowers developers to tap into GPU parallel processing capabilities, making complex calculations faster and more efficient, and thereby driving innovation across various fields.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Autonomous Driving and Competition\n",
      "\n",
      "NVIDIA is also a key player in the autonomous vehicle sector. The company’s Drive platform provides AI solutions that enable vehicles to navigate and make real-time decisions, positioning itself as a crucial partner for major automotive companies. However, NVIDIA operates in a competitive landscape including formidable players like AMD and Intel, which are continuously innovating in GPU technologies and AI solutions. Keeping an eye on emerging companies and startups in these fields is essential, as they may present new challenges to NVIDIA’s market dominance.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Global Impact and Sustainability\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond technology, NVIDIA's innovations have significant implications for various industries and global practices. As sectors like healthcare, finance, and manufacturing adopt AI solutions, NVIDIA's contributions are facilitating transformative changes in efficiency and capability. The company is also committed to sustainability; it is developing hardware that is more energy-efficient and investing in greener technologies. This not only reduces the carbon footprint but also ensures that progress benefits society as a whole.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "NVIDIA’s journey from a gaming graphics company to a multifaceted tech leader is a testament to its adaptability. Its pioneering technologies in GPUs, AI, and autonomous vehicles position it as a trailblazer in an ever-evolving landscape. However, as the tech world becomes increasingly competitive, NVIDIA must remain vigilant of competitors and emerging companies that could reshape market dynamics. With a focus on innovation and sustainability, NVIDIA is well-equipped to continue powering the future of technology, shaping the way we interact with the digital world for years to come.\n",
