    "# Task Solving with Code Generation, Execution and Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate how to use `AssistantAgent` and `UserProxyAgent` to write code and execute the code. Here `AssistantAgent` is an LLM-based agent that can write Python code (in a Python coding block) for a user to execute for a given task. `UserProxyAgent` is an agent which serves as a proxy for the human user to execute the code written by `AssistantAgent`, or automatically execute the code. Depending on the setting of `human_input_mode` and `max_consecutive_auto_reply`, the `UserProxyAgent` either solicits feedback from the human user or returns auto-feedback based on the result of code execution (success or failure and corresponding outputs) to `AssistantAgent`. `AssistantAgent` will debug the code and suggest new code if the result contains error. The two agents keep communicating to each other until the task is done.\n",

This means that the `UserProxyAgent` will not solicit feedback from the human user.
